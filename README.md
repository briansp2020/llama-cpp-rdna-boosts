# llama-cpp-rdna-boosts

A patch collection that brings **AMD RDNA-specific performance work** to
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp): MTP decode, chunked
gated-delta-net prefill, BF16 KV and WMMA flash-attention, fused MoE and
k-quant decode paths, a hybrid all-reduce, qwen4exp (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next)
support, and an attention-memory campaign that frees several GiB of VRAM.

**Everything this delivery adds is default-on — you should not need to set any environment variable.**
[`ENVIRONMENT.md`](ENVIRONMENT.md) documents every variable the set adds or repoints: its default, and
whether it is a kill-switch (default-on, set to disable), an opt-in, a tuning value, or a diagnostic.

It ships as **16 patches** (block 00 + blocks 01-15) for a clean llama.cpp
checkout at the fork point **`a55e952b8`** (upstream master, 2026-10-03
re-base).  Each block is a self-contained `git am` commit, so you can apply
the whole set or pick the ones you want.  The **`mmb` (bf16-WMMA weight GEMM) / QSA / indexer
campaign**, formerly the 28-patch opt-in `archive/work/mmb-general/` set, is now **folded into the delivery
blocks** — the `mmb` core into block 08, the catch-all system-operations fixes into block 06, and the
qwen4exp/QSA/HC/indexer work into block 15 — so the **16 patches alone reproduce the full campaign
tree**.  `archive/work/mmb-general/` is retained only as the historical verification record;
see [The `mmb` campaign is in the delivery](#the-mmb-campaign-is-in-the-delivery).  The current release is
**`v16-a55e952b8-r40`**: the device-remap (`DEVMAP`/`DEVPOLICY`/`KSLOT`/`DEV_EAGER`) experiment is
**removed from the code base** — block 06 no longer creates it, so the eager host-routing path is the sole
`-sm tensor` split policy — and the non-devmap WIP fixes ride with it (the per-table fusion guard that
resolves **issue #50**, the narrow-2 slab MTP-aliasing fix, and `-ncmoe` host-expert offload).  The device
path's divergence was a layout-sensitive **hipBLASLt** solution flip (**issue #67**), not a cache bug;
removing it is MTP-pure on qwen4exp, within noise of the old `DEVMAP=0` performance, and keeps the
prefill-logit gate at mean KLD 0.000707.  Before it, **`v16-a55e952b8-r38`** folded the `fit-slab-accounting` revival into block 06 (G1/G2 `--fit`
arena+headroom reservation, G3 adaptive slab reserve, G4 `GGML_CUDA_OPTIONAL_ALLOC_MAX_FREE_PCT`
free-VRAM cap, G5 split-slice guard, G6 nextn-offload guard, G7 scheduler multi-consumer fill,
per-device host-expert accounting) plus the G4 FA-staging cap in block 15.  Before it,
**`v16-a55e952b8-r36`** (three contributor prefill PRs folded into the existing blocks: the shared BF16
src1 reuse (#119) and the in-place host-expert prefill reads (#121) in block 15, and the pool free-VRAM
floor plus the 6 GiB `-sm layer` slab headroom (#122) in blocks 06 and 09).  Before it,
**`v16-a55e952b8-r35`** folded the bounded pinned host-expert pool into block 06: `--host-experts
pool` adds an **optional** host pool over the page cache, sized to `MOE_HOST_POOL_MIB` (auto = 25 % of the
MoE host expert bytes); the default stays `pinned`, and the `mul_mat_vec_q_moe` row-tail clamp is in block
13.  Before that, **`v16-a55e952b8-r33`** removed the pageable host-expert master (**issue #116**:
`--host-experts mmap` and `LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS` are dropped, `-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` experts are always
pinned, and `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB` below 2048 errors).  Before that, **`v16-a55e952b8-r32`** fixed the two crashes found
during the PR #115 review (the multi-sequence post-prefill re-reserve, **issue #48** in block 06, and the
meta split-state stack overflow, **issue #49** in block 15).  Before that, **`v16-a55e952b8-r31`** (PR #115 folded into block 06: the MoE
expert-cache decode/verify band follows the routed-expert MMVQ band -- **16 tokens on RDNA4** -- so
12-16-token MTP verify batches stay on the arena; 16-token MoE batches **+5.7x**, `draft-mtp n-max 12`
**+3.3x**, purity unchanged, `GGML_MOE_CACHE_MAX_TOK=8` restores the old band).  Before it,
**`v16-a55e952b8-r30`**: **issue #113 root-caused and fixed -- the BF16/WMMA chunked GDN path is
default-on again.**  The r29 KLD was an `A_sc` stride aliasing bug for `n_seqs > 1`, not bf16 precision;
it is fixed in both GDN kernel files, and the op test's gates are now realistic with its bf16 tolerance
tightened to 1e-4.  Mean KLD is back to 0.000707 / 0.000052 / 0.000150 (gfx1201 / gfx1100 / gfx1151) and
prefill bf16 vs fp32 is +7.7/+7.9/+7.5 % on gfx1201, +4.2/+4.4/+3.9 % on gfx1100 and +5.1/+5.5/+4.5 %
on gfx1151.  **`v16-a55e952b8-r29`** was: **the lossy BF16/WMMA chunked GDN path is now opt-in
(issue #113)** -- the
`GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED_BF16` default is flipped on -> off, because the bf16 kernel shifts prefill
logits against the fp32 chunked/sequential path (mean KLD 0.032 / same-top-p 94 % on gfx1201, 0.62 /
79 % on gfx1100) while the fp32 chunked kernel is clean (0.0005 / 99 %) and still beats sequential.
The flip costs -7 % prefill on gfx1201 and -4 % on gfx1100; `=1` restores the old behaviour.
**`v16-a55e952b8-r28`** was: **the `--host-experts` flag folded into block 06** -- the `-ncmoe`/`-cmoe`
host-expert backing becomes a first-class `--host-experts <pinned|mmap|auto>` option
(`llama_model_params.host_experts_mode`), default pinned unchanged, the legacy `LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS`
env kept.  `--host-experts mmap` keeps the expert master in the pageable model mmap instead of the pinned
`ROCm_Host` buffer: ~5 % slower prefill / ~0.5 % decode on 1x R9700 (35B-A3B Q4_K_M, `-ncmoe 40`), peak
RSS **40.7 -> 22.2 GB** (the ~18.6 GB non-swappable `ROCm_Host` set becomes reclaimable page cache),
greedy text byte-identical.  **`v16-a55e952b8-r27`** was: **PR #114 (@briansp2020) folded into block 15** -- four bit-identical qwen4exp
decode fusions (the latency-scheduled BF16 `hc_mix` up/collapse, `HC_COMBINE` folded into the norm that
reads it, the shared-expert `sigmoid`-`mul`-`add` gate, and the GDN `beta` sigmoid folded into the
sequential kernel), each with a default-on `=0` kill-switch.  Measured here: **+2.4 % decode** (3-GPU
`-sm tensor`, qwen4exp IQ3_XXS + MTP, byte-identical text) and **+12-21 %** on the `HC_MIX` op itself;
`HC_MIX 30/30`, `GATED_DELTA_NET 46/46`, dense 4B same-seed unchanged.  **`v16-a55e952b8-r26`** was
**PR #107** (DFlash F1 warn-and-fall-back plus default-on) and **PR #110** (DPP wave32 warp butterflies
behind the build-time `-DGGML_HIP_NO_DPP_XOR` gate), plus a warning-free build.  **`v16-a55e952b8-r25`**:
**PR #106 (issue #105) folded into blocks 06/08/14/15, minus its patch 0002**,
plus `TODO #45`.  In: the retired-Q8_1-arena fix, the graph memory generation, the 8-version compacted
meta split-state cache, qwen4exp's `block_out` unpin and planar HC_MIX, the conv-state tail copy, and the
opt-in `LLAMA_KV_N_PAD_MIN`.  **Not in:** patch 0002 (hashing node/source `data` pointers into the graph
key), because on the r22+ slab it invalidates warm graphs and recaptures (measured 41.8 vs 51.8 t/s at
`--spec-draft-p-min 0.5`, 88.2 vs 94.9 at p-min 0, identical text and MTP acceptance).  **`v16-a55e952b8-r24`**: the **MoE expert-cache floor decides early again** (`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIN_MIB`
used to corrupt a run -- acceptance 0.00874 instead of 0.91797 -- because the early preflight walked the Meta
device instead of the real device, leaving only a late, graph-breaking disable; the preflight now walks the
host-expert map and runs before the context, and a late trip only warns), plus a **repack** that moves the
whole **cache + arena/slab subsystem from blocks 13/14/15 into block 06** (blocks 07-15 rebased onto it;
no code change, proven by tree equality).  **`v16-a55e952b8-r23`** was **diagnostics hygiene** found by the r22
field run — six unconditional `MMB_*`
stderr prints are gated on `GGML_CUDA_MMB_LOG`, `ggml_cuda_slab_extend` reports post-mapping free VRAM, the
stale-alias count is surfaced, and the teardown compute-buffer size check no longer fires on a legitimate
mid-run shrink.  **`v16-a55e952b8-r22`** was the **movable-boundary slab allocator** — ONE slab per device,
reserved and mapped
exactly once and split by a movable boundary (compute buffer below, MoE arena above), so a wide prefill and
a large arena coexist and **HIP is never called at runtime** (nothing is ever unmapped, so the ROCm
sub-range `hipMemUnmap` limitation stops mattering).  It ends the TODO #42 server crash: the wide-prefill
drop is now default **on for every tool**, and `wide1 -> short -> wide2` at `-ub 8192` runs with **0 aborts**
(server arena 15908.8 -> 38026.8 MiB, 67.0 % residency).  DoD `-ub 8192` cache-auto 16k: decode **74.2 t/s**
/ prefill **1712.9 t/s**, coherent; MTP `-n 3000 --reasoning on` acceptance **bit-identical to r21**
(0.53519).  `GGML_CUDA_SLAB=0` is the kill switch; see `ENVIRONMENT.md` §1.3.  Since **r37** the slab (and the
slab-motivated compute chunk) is **armed only for models with host-resident experts**; a dense model never
creates one (issues #118/#120).

## Releases

Frozen deliveries are published as GitHub Releases and tagged in this repo
(the tag is the release identity: `v16-<fork-point>-r<N>`, e.g. **`v16-a55e952b8-r26`**.  `r1` is the
re-base of the set onto that fork point and every later `rN` is a dated change recorded in
[`WORKLOG.md`](WORKLOG.md), newest first).

## Supported architectures

The set targets the **RDNA3 / RDNA3.5 / RDNA4** GPU families:

| family | arches | example parts |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| RDNA 3 | `gfx1100` | RX 7900 XTX/XT, RX 7800 XT, ... |
| RDNA 3.5 | `gfx1150`/`gfx1151` | Strix Point / Strix Halo APUs |
| RDNA 4 | `gfx1200`/`gfx1201` | RX 9060 XT; RX 9070 / 9070 XT |

> **Strix Point (`gfx1150`) is in the target set as of 2026-10-05.**  Images
> published before then (for example the `server-rocm-10.0` build at `2dbece4`)
> carry no `gfx1150` code object and fail on the first kernel launch (`ROCm
> error: device kernel image is invalid`).  For those, build from source with
> `gfx1150` in the target list, or set `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.5.1` at
> runtime to select the `gfx1151` code objects.  See [Strix Point
> (gfx1150)](CONTAINERS.md#strix-point-gfx1150) for the validation and both
> paths.

**RDNA4 (gfx120x) sees the most benefit** — the WMMA flash-attn path, the
chunked-GDN kernel, the k-quant VDR boosts and block 12's internal
all-reduce were all first built and validated there. As much of that work
as possible is back-ported to the RDNA3/3.5 families instead of being
gated off:

- block 02's **chunked gated-delta-net** bf16/WMMA prefill ships as two
  arch-segregated kernels: a dedicated first-gen WMMA port for gfx11
  (`gated_delta_net_chunked_bf16_gfx11.cu`) next to the RDNA4 kernel;
- block 04's **WMMA flash-attn** is *not* RDNA4-only despite the block
  name — RDNA3.0 runs it with the same 576-head limit as RDNA4, RDNA3.5
  with a tuned 320-head limit;
- block 10 adds a **dedicated RDNA3.5 mmvq parameter table** (previously
  folded into the RDNA2 fallback) on top of the RDNA4 k-quant boosts.

Arch selection is **runtime** everywhere in the set (device `cc` /
`gcnArchName`; there is no compile-time arch gating), so a multi-arch
build such as `GPU_TARGETS="gfx1100;gfx1151;gfx1201"` yields one binary
that picks the right path on whichever of these it runs on. The one
genuine exception is **block 12** — its internal all-reduce is RDNA4-only
(gfx1200/gfx1201) and falls back to RCCL elsewhere (see
`patches/README.md` for the gate and env knobs).  Block 13's fused
MoE MMQ gate now covers RDNA4 + RDNA3_5 + RDNA3_0 (gfx1151 validated
2026-09-05, gfx1100 validated 2026-09-05 — see
[Current state](#current-state)).

## The 16 blocks

| patch | what |
|-------|------|
| `0000` | **structural and architecture fixes** — FA small-batch KV-split width invariance (issue #25) + Vulkan masked-V/freed-cell fixes (dead columns never read V). The base every later block applies on top of. |
| `0001` | adaptive MTP draft depth (`--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive`) |
| `0002` | fused chunked gated-delta-net prefill kernel (bf16/WMMA, arch-segregated gfx12/gfx11) |
| `0003` | BF16 KV cache + native-BF16 flash-attn (+ the HIP masked-V/freed-cell fixes since 2026-09-10) |
| `0004` | RDNA4 WMMA flash-attn + Q6_K mmq prefill perf (WMMA path also runs on RDNA3.0/3.5, tuned head limits) |
| `0005` | CPU bit-identical decode/verify batches |
| `0006` | **general system-operations bucket** — the delivery's **catch-all** for changes that fit no other block: the FA instance build-time work, `--fit` under `-sm tensor`, the host-buffer input layer, the tiny-CPU-split single-thread fix and (r12) the op-offload **H2D staging ring** + tensor-split op-offload.  Named for what it is since r12; the original host-buffer revert content is long gone (upstream reverted #24233 in #28604).  Amended r13 (issue #52): the tiny-CPU-split heuristic now counts what a graph *reads* — not only its node outputs — so a CPU-offloaded FFN chunk keeps the full thread pool |
| `0007` | meta device-wrapper skip |
| `0008` | fused-core prefill kernels + GPU bit-identical results (needs blocks 03+04; amended 2026-09-07 with the mul_mat+add through-view shape guard, PR #15). **Now folds the `mmb` (bf16-WMMA dequant weight GEMM) core, the RDNA4 fragment port / per-arch tuning, and the GDN/PLE conv1d + narrow-row RMS-norm prefill fusions** (absorbed from the former `archive/work/mmb-general` campaign). |
| `0009` | meta-buffer compute-container headroom |
| `0010` | k-quant-boosts: Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K/Q8_0 mmvq VDR (+ q8_1 quantize-cache fusions; adds a dedicated RDNA3.5 mmvq table) |
| `0011` | skip CUDA graphs for multi-token PRE-FILL (decode keeps graph replay) |
| `0012` | **hybrid HIP all-reduce** — custom internal AR for the small-tensor decode path, per-size hybrid dispatch vs RCCL, RDNA4-only gate (bounded in-kernel spin since 2026-08-30 fix round; builds without RCCL) |
| `0013` | **fused MoE gate+up+GLU MMQ + mmvq short-K item-split** — prefill fused expert MMQ (RDNA4 + RDNA3_5 + RDNA3_0, Q3_K/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q8_0/Q6_K, env opt-out `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MOE_MMQ_FUSION`) + decode item-split (rpb 2/4/8) merged with the upstream has_fusion mmvq path |
| `0014` | **qwen4exp / Qwen3.8-Flash-Next support** — QSA sparse FA (default) + fused indexer top-k, HC_MIX/HC_COMBINE fused decode ops, managed lazy reader, MTP draft-head, WS4 hyperconn prefill fusions, QSA decode campaign + per-arch dense/QSA decode policy (promoted from `beta/qwen4exp`; see `patches/README.md` block-14 notes). The masked-V/freed-cell fixes it once carried now live in blocks 00 (Vulkan) and 03 (HIP). |
| `0015` | **attention-memory wins (block 15)** — promoted 2026-09-12 from `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/`: **V3** derived kq mask (`LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED`, on by default), **V4** native q8_0 + **V5** native bf16 K/V in the FA kernels (both behind `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE`, opt-in default 0), **W1** QSA score-chain memory (`GGML_QSA_SCORE_MEM`), **W2** derived QSA per-block bias + visibility (`GGML_QSA_DERIVED_BIAS`/`GGML_QSA_DERIVED_VIS`), **W3** keys-only QSA indexer cache (`LLAMA_QSA_KEYS_ONLY`), **W4** ggml-alloc unused-view release (no gate; A/B revert in `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/ab/`).  ~3.4 GiB/GPU + ~1.2 GiB host saved on qwen4exp, ~800 MiB/GPU + ~800 MiB host on dense models, at ~1.3 % prefill / ~0.3 % decode. **Now also folds the qwen4exp/QSA/HC/indexer campaign** (`qsa3` packed-block WMMA attention, fused indexer top-k + prefill score fusions, HC16 native-BF16 producers, `hc_gate_mix`, sparse MTP-draft attention, the sparse-QSA/derived-indexer defaults, and the host-buffer/CPU/meta fixes) — the former `archive/work/mmb-general` work.  Also carries the r14-r21 **MoE expert-cache** work: auto sizing, host-pinned expert buffers, the op-offload H2D staging path, the compute-buffer slack, the fail-soft arena yield, the per-layer uniform slot re-size (`t.slots` fix), the `MTP_DRAFT_N_UBATCH` cap, and the cli-only wide-prefill drop.  **r22 adds the movable-boundary slab allocator** (ONE slab per device, reserved and mapped once, split by a movable boundary: compute buffer below, MoE arena above, HIP never called at runtime) which SUPERSEDES the per-allocation VMM pool (removed) and the fail-soft arena yield, sizes the arena on a decode-band pass, right-sizes the compute reserve to the observed workload, and makes the wide-prefill drop default-on for servers too — the TODO #42 abort is gone. **r27 folds PR #114's four qwen4exp decode fusions:** the latency-scheduled BF16 `hc_mix` up/collapse (`GGML_HC_UP_V2=0`), `HC_COMBINE` fused into that norm (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_HC_COMBINE_MIX=0`), the shared-expert `sigmoid`-`mul`-`add` gate (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_SIGMOID_MUL_ADD=0`), and the GDN `beta` sigmoid folded into the sequential kernel (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GDN_BETA_SIGMOID=0`); +2.4 % decode on qwen4exp, byte-identical text. |

> **The delivery is `0000`–`0015` (16 patches).**  Release `v16-a55e952b8-r16` briefly shipped two

> both back into the existing blocks**, so they are documented in the `0006`/`0013`/`0015` rows above and
> the prose at the top of this section — there is no `patches/0016*.patch`.

### Manual equivalent

```bash
git am patches/000[1-9]-*.patch patches/001[0-5]-*.patch   # blocks 01-15
git add -A && git commit -m "rdna-boosts: block 15: campaign memory wins"
```

### The `mmb` campaign is in the delivery

On the **`beta-integration`** branch the `mmb` (bf16-WMMA dequant weight GEMM) / QSA / indexer
campaign — the former 28-patch `archive/work/mmb-general/` set — is **folded directly into the 16 delivery
blocks**, so the normal workflow above is all there is to apply.  There is **no separate beta layer
any more**:

* **block 08** absorbs the `mmb` core, the RDNA4 fragment port and per-arch tuning, and the
  GDN/PLE conv1d + narrow-row RMS-norm prefill fusions;
* **block 06** (the catch-all system-operations bucket) absorbs the host-buffer input layer and the tiny-CPU-split
  single-thread fix;
* **blocks 13/14** absorb the `mmb` fusion stand-downs and the extended MMVQ routed band;
* **block 15** absorbs `qsa3`, the fused indexer top-k + prefill score fusions, HC16, `hc_gate_mix`,
  sparse MTP-draft attention, the sparse-QSA/derived-indexer defaults, and the meta/CPU backend fixes.

Applying the 16 patches to the fork point in [`release.json`](release.json) therefore reproduces the
**full campaign tree** in one pass:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp && cd llama.cpp
git checkout a55e952b8          # the base recorded in release.json
bash <path-to-this-repo>/scripts/apply-all.sh .   # 16/16 strict, tree checked against release.json
```

The per-patch fold mapping and validation record are in
[`archive/work/beta-integration/integration.md`](archive/work/beta-integration/integration.md).  Much of the MMB
kernel work is heavily adapted from **[pwilkin](https://github.com/pwilkin)**'s
[`strix-halo` fork](https://github.com/pwilkin/llama.cpp/commits/strix-halo/), with thanks.

> `mmb-general.patch`, `BETA-TESTING.md`, the gfx1201/gfx1100 records) is kept as the campaign's

> the fold relies on.

## Recommended configuration — adaptive MTP + `ngram-mod`

The best general-purpose speculative-decoding configuration measured on this delivery combines the
**adaptive MTP controller** with the draftless **`ngram-mod`** speculator:

```bash
--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive,ngram-mod \
  --spec-ngram-mod-n-match 45 \
  --spec-draft-n-max 9 --spec-draft-n-start 9
```

`ngram-mod` supplies the long verbatim-recall drafts the MTP head cannot match, while the adaptive
controller keeps the MTP depth right for everything else.  Measured against plain `draft-mtp-adaptive`
on the Q8_0 2-GPU reference cell (`-n 3000`, a 4-prompts-per-axis corpus): **recall +67.5 %,
code +0.8 %, prose +0.5 %, reasoning −1.9 %, overall +13.6 %**; on the dense 1-card cell it is
code/prose-neutral with the same recall win.  The small reasoning cost is the price of the deeper
`n-max 9`; a workload with no verbatim recall is marginally better served by plain
`draft-mtp-adaptive`.

Guidance:

* **Cap.**  `9` is the general-purpose pick and the optimum on a **single card** (a cap of `6` costs
  11-14 % on code there).  On a **multi-card tensor split** `6-7` is ~1 % better.  A lower cap saves
  only a small verify-batch scratch, not the model/KV memory.
* **`n_match`.**  Keep it `>= 40` **and an integer multiple of the cap** — `9/45`, `8/48`, `6/42`.
  Too short (`nm24`) makes ngram fire on incidental code repeats and lose code throughput; a
  non-multiple (e.g. `nm42` at cap 12) degrades acceptance.
* The combo changes the draft strategy, so it is **opt-in** — the controller default stays plain
  `--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive`.

## VRAM vs prefill — the derived KQ mask (`LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED`)

**On by default, deliberately.**  The delivery derives the attention mask inside the FA kernel from
compact per-cell state instead of materialising the `n_kv x n_q` f16 mask.  That removes
`n_ubatch x n_ctx x 2` bytes of compute-buffer VRAM **plus the same again on the host** — measured on
a 9B at `-c 98304` / ub 512: **184.0 -> 88.4 MiB** device and **112.0 -> 16.4 MiB** host.  The saving
scales linearly with the ubatch, which is the point: a deep-context **MoE** or **qwen4exp /
Qwen3.8-Flash-Next** workload wants a large ubatch, and that is exactly the configuration where the
mask is biggest (~800 MiB/GPU at ub 2048 / 196k) and where the VRAM the feature frees is the
difference between fitting the context and not.

The cost is **prefill only** — decode is untouched, because the derived path only fires for batches
larger than 8 tokens (speculative verify keeps the packed mask, so `n_max <= 7` stays bit-identical).
Measured PP512, mask on vs off, `-r 3` ("+" = the mask helps):

| config | d0 | 32k | 64k | 98k |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| gfx1201 9B dense 1 GPU | — | +1.9 % | — | **+3.5 %** |
| gfx1201 27B 2 GPU **tensor** | −1.3 % | −0.4 % | **+1.3 %** | **+1.7 %** |
| gfx1201 27B 2 GPU layer | — | — | — | −1.6 % |
| gfx1201 27B 3 GPU tensor | −3.4 % | −0.6 % | — | **+2.0 %** |
| gfx1151 9B dense 1 GPU | +0.4 % | −0.2 % | −0.9 % | −1.8 % |
| gfx1151 35B-A3B MoE 1 GPU | −0.3 % | −0.3 % | −0.8 % | −1.6 % |
| gfx1100 9B dense 1 GPU | −0.4 % | −0.5 % | −0.4 % | **−0.2 %** |

The tensor-split shape is the one to understand: the packed mask grows with `n_kv`, so on a
**tensor split at shallow depth the mask is a small loss (−1.3 % at d0, crossing zero near 48k) and
becomes a win by 64k+**; on the maintainer's 3-GPU tensor serving setup it is a win at depth.  gfx1100
and gfx1151 pay a depth-growing ~1–2 % (they did not recover as much from the r7 kernel fix as
gfx1201 — the iGPU shares host bandwidth and the 7900 XTX has more of its own).  gfx1100 on a
dual-card **`-sm tensor`** split is the one cell we still cannot measure here (only a single 7900 XTX
is available); a community report on 2x RX 7900 XTX is pending.

**Turning it off.**  `LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED=0` restores the packed mask (upstream's behaviour).
Worth doing if you are on **gfx1100/gfx1151** and want the last ~1–2 % of deep prefill, or on a
**tensor split at shallow depth** and prefill latency matters more than the VRAM.  For a deep-context
MoE / qwen4exp workload the default is the right side of the trade.

**Not a correctness knob:** same-seed output is byte-identical either way (the derived mask produces
the same values; only the memory layout and prefill cost differ).

**It works on both prefill kernels (r9).**  The derived mask is implemented by the **MMA** and the
**tile** flash-attention kernels, so it is no longer tied to the chooser picking MMA: a head above the
per-arch WMMA cap (RDNA4 576, RDNA3_5 320, RDNA3_0 256) used to lose the mask entirely, and that is
every **Gemma4** (head 512) on gfx1100/gfx1151 — the two arches that live on the tile kernel.  There
the mask is a *win*, not a tax (PP512, mask on vs off):

| config (tile kernel, natural selection) | cell | delta |
|---|---|---|
| gfx1100 Gemma4 12B, q8_0 KV | @ 16k / @ 32k | **+1.2 %** / **+0.9 %** |
| gfx1151 Gemma4 12B, q8_0 KV | @ 16k / @ 32k | **+1.6 %** / +0.6 % |
| gfx1201 Gemma4 E4B (tile forced) | @ d0 | **+2.3 %** |

and **decode pays nothing for it.**  Decode and the spec verify batch always take the tile kernel (the
chooser's WMMA branch requires `ne[1] > 8`), so the derived branch there is a cost on every arch; it is
hoisted out of the KV loop so the packed path's code generation is unchanged.  Measured r8 vs r9 at
that kernel: `tg128` deltas of **+0.01 %** (gfx1201 9B @ d16384), **+0.02 %** (gfx1100 9B @ d16384),
and flat on gfx1151 — the earlier per-iteration form cost −0.5..−0.8 % at depth before the hoist.

**The vec kernel has no derived arm**, but it is decode/verify-only (`n_tps <= 2`) while the derived
form only exists for prefill-shaped batches (`kq_mask_derivable()` rejects `n_tokens <= 8`), so it
cannot be selected for one.  If the launch log *does* print `derived kq mask flash attention not
supported, set to disabled` on a CUDA/HIP backend, the FA node did not reach the GPU at all — check
which kernel serves that head (the log adds a note pointing there).

One performance caveat with nothing to do with this knob: forcing the **tile** kernel for a head it
would not normally serve (a stale `GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_256=0`, a fixed env in the September qwen4exp
gates, is the usual cause) makes a head-256 model on gfx1201 **~3x slower at deep prefill** (9B,
`-d 98304`: 2104 -> 710 t/s).  That env is worth removing regardless of the derived mask.  One
exception worth knowing: **qwen4exp / Qwen3.8-Flash-Next gets its deep-context mask elision from the
QSA path's own derived visibility** (`GGML_QSA_DERIVED_VIS`, the code's "-800 MiB win"), which is
independent of this knob; `LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED` only serves that model's dense shortcut
(`n_kv <= 2051`), where the mask is tiny.

## Cross-start determinism on ROCm (issue #67)

Issue [#67](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/issues/67) (from #58 item D, reported by
[@DanoPTT](https://github.com/DanoPTT) on Windows / ROCm 10 / gfx1201) tracked Q6_K greedy output that
intermittently swapped one near-tie across fresh `llama-server` starts while staying deterministic within
a start.  It is **closed as an external ROCm issue — nothing to fix in this patch set.**  Two separate
defects were in play:

* **A real bit-transparency bug in the fused rope path, fixed in r25.**  The address-gated
  `ROPE -> VIEW -> SET_ROWS` fusion did not reproduce the unfused chain bit-for-bit: clang contracted the
  fused `<float,__half>` and unfused `<float,float>` template instantiations differently, and one element
  of the prefill K-cache write landed on opposite sides of an f16 rounding boundary.  r25's
  `#pragma clang fp contract(off)` in `rope.cu` makes every instantiation round identically, verified at
  the logits level on Linux (`W=1` hash `60e77916673db071` with the fusion on and off).  See
  [Current state](#current-state) for the r25 record.

* **The residual per-start flip is hipBLASLt solution selection in ROCm, not ggml** — and it reproduces
  on a stock upstream build with none of these patches.  The F32 `mul_mat` for `ssm_alpha`/`ssm_beta`
  (5120 -> 48) at 512 prefill columns misses the mmvf/mmf kernels, goes to `hipblasSgemm`, and rocBLAS
  routes it to hipBLASLt (`rocblaslt_matmul`, T,N, m=48 n=512 k=5120).  `HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK=160` shows a
  per-process pick between a bit-identical reference solution pair (`140231`/`140232`) and a deviating
  pair (`140216`/`140217`); it is random from process to process, so layer 0's prefill output — and with
  it the whole run — differs at startup.  This is
  [ROCm/rocm-libraries#12126](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/issues/12126).

**Workaround: `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0`.**  On the reporter's setup, 150 fresh starts per arm: default
**5/150** deviate, `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0` **0/150** (bit-identical to the reference class), with no
measurable prefill/decode cost on the current build (the earlier text-hash runs measured higher flip
rates, up to ~14 %).  `ROCBLAS_DEFAULT_ATOMICS_MODE=0` does not help.  The selection is **prefill-only**
(decode at n=1 uses mmvf), so decode throughput is unaffected.

**Linux / ROCm 7.14 does not reproduce it** — the reporter's box (Windows / ROCm 10) is where the
per-process selection actually varies.  The r24 rope-fusion kill switches
(`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_ROPE_SET_ROWS=1`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_RMS_NORM_MUL_ROPE=1`) and r25's fix remain
shipped for bisection and for the real defect above.

## When upstream master moves

The patches are static against the fork point in `release.json.base`. When upstream
drifts and hunks no longer apply, re-base the block commits (the fork checkout carries
them), regenerate the whole set with `scripts/make-patches.sh`, then refresh
`release.json` (`scripts/make-release.sh --base … --tip … --tree …`) and update the
current-state headers. The old `baseline/<sha>`-branch-per-upstream-range workflow
was retired when the delivery moved to the flat 16-patch set on `main`.

## Upstreaming

Some blocks are candidates for upstream contribution to
[ggml-org/llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp); others are
expected to stay fork-local. Block 12's internal all-reduce is gated to
RDNA4 pending community verification on RDNA3 pairs. See `MANIFESTS.md`
for per-block verification and `BASELINE.md` for provenance.

## Current state

The delivery is the **16-patch set** (block 00 + blocks 01-15) for a clean llama.cpp checkout at the fork
point recorded in [`release.json`](release.json) (**`a55e952b8`**, upstream master, 2026-10-03 re-base); the
**current release is `v16-a55e952b8-r39`**: the op-offload H2D staging ring moves **inside** the
movable-boundary slab (block 06 + block 15), so it stops competing with the post-slab consumers for the
slab headroom and the r38 G4 default's ~16 % field-prefill cost is gone (field §5.5 prefill 781 -> 946 t/s
at a 2.5 GiB region / 992 at 6 GiB, vs 922 stock; decode 61.1-61.4 vs 62.2; 0 NaN).  Before it,
**`v16-a55e952b8-r38`**: the `fit-slab-accounting` revival is folded into block 06
(G1/G2 `--fit` arena+headroom reservation, G3 adaptive slab reserve, G4
`GGML_CUDA_OPTIONAL_ALLOC_MAX_FREE_PCT` free-VRAM cap, G5 split-slice guard, G6 nextn-offload guard,
G7 scheduler multi-consumer fill, per-device host-expert accounting) plus the G4 FA-staging cap in
block 15.  Before it, **`v16-a55e952b8-r34`**: block 12's hybrid all-reduce no longer initialises NCCL
eagerly -- NCCL comes up lazily on the first tensor too large for the internal pipeline (prefill), so a
decode-only `-sm tensor` run never pays for it.  Eager `ncclCommInitAll` measurably degraded the
internal pipeline ~3x even when no collective used it, which kept `-sm tensor` MoE decode at ~22 t/s
instead of ~67 (now 69.5 t/s at `-ncmoe 0` on 3x R9700, output unchanged).  Before it,
**`v16-a55e952b8-r33`** removed the pageable `--host-experts mmap` host master (issue #116: an RDNA part
without XNACK cannot read a pageable address in a kernel), dropped `--host-experts mmap` /
`LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS`, made the `-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` master always pinned and added the
`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB >= 2048` floor.  Before it, **`v16-a55e952b8-r32`** was (both crashes found during
the PR #115 review are fixed: issue #48, the post-prefill re-reserve no longer builds a zero-token
attention graph for a multi-sequence decode, block 06; issue #49, the meta split-state computation no
longer overflows the stack on a deep `src` chain, block 15).  Before it, **`v16-a55e952b8-r31`** was: PR #115 folded into
block 06, the MoE expert-cache decode/verify band follows the routed-expert MMVQ band -- 16 tokens on
RDNA4 -- so 12-16-token MTP verify batches stay on the arena; 16-token MoE batch +5.7x, `draft-mtp
n-max 12` +3.3x, `n_max <= 7` pure, `GGML_MOE_CACHE_MAX_TOK=8` restores the old band.  Before it,
**`v16-a55e952b8-r30`** was: issue #113 root-caused and fixed: the r29 divergence was an
`A_sc` stride aliasing bug for `n_seqs > 1`, so `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED_BF16` is default-on again at a
near-lossless mean KLD of 0.0007 / 0.00005 / 0.00015 on gfx1201 / gfx1100 / gfx1151).  Before it,
`v16-a55e952b8-r29` flipped the bf16 path off as a workaround; `v16-a55e952b8-r28` folded the `--host-experts` flag into block 06 (the
`-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` host-expert backing becomes `--host-experts <pinned|mmap|auto>`, default pinned, the legacy
`LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS` kept; `mmap` trades ~5 % prefill for ~18.6 GB less non-swappable host RAM; the
previous `v16-a55e952b8-r27` folded PR #114's four bit-identical qwen4exp decode fusions into block 15,
and `v16-a55e952b8-r26` added PR #107's DFlash F1 warn-and-fall-back plus default-on and PR #110's DPP
wave32 warp butterflies behind the build-time `-DGGML_HIP_NO_DPP_XOR` gate).  `release.json` is the single source of truth for the canonical
tip/tree, the block count and every artifact hash, and [`WORKLOG.md`](WORKLOG.md) records the dated history
of every change, newest first.

The set applies with **strict 16/16 `git am`** (no 3-way fallback, whitespace-clean) via
`scripts/apply-all.sh`, and `scripts/validate-set.sh` re-checks the artifact hashes, the strict apply and
the applied tree against `release.json`.  Per-block notes, environment knobs and the server configuration
are in [`patches/README.md`](patches/README.md); apply order and the verification contract in
[`MANIFESTS.md`](MANIFESTS.md); fork point and drift policy in [`BASELINE.md`](BASELINE.md); the purity
