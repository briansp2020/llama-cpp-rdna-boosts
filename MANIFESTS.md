# MANIFESTS - apply order and verification contract

Squashed, standalone diff blocks of RDNA-specific performance and correctness
work from the [llama.cpp fork](https://github.com/stew675/llama.cpp)
(`rdna-boosts` branch), packaged for easy application to mainline llama.cpp.

The **current delivery** is a **16-patch set** (block 00 + blocks 01-15) against upstream master
**`a55e952b8`**, released as **`v16-a55e952b8-r38`** (canonical block-15 tip `849c04161`, net tree
`888564105e13dd73fefda755ea5b055d65011c16`): the `fit-slab-accounting` revival is folded into
block 06 (G1/G2 `--fit` arena+headroom reservation, G3 adaptive slab reserve, G4
`GGML_CUDA_OPTIONAL_ALLOC_MAX_FREE_PCT` free-VRAM cap, G5 split-slice guard, G6 nextn-offload guard,
G7 scheduler multi-consumer fill, per-device host-expert accounting) plus the G4 FA-staging cap in
block 15.  Before it, **`v16-a55e952b8-r36`** (canonical block-15 tip `8e28631f6`, net tree
`d55aebfe0d7af530aa485ffd7ebf5e1dce331b08`): three contributor prefill PRs are folded into the existing
blocks (shared BF16 src1 reuse #119 and in-place host-expert prefill reads #121 into block 15; the pool
free-VRAM floor #122-0001 into block 06 and the 6 GiB `-sm layer` slab headroom #122-0002 into block 09).
Before it, **`v16-a55e952b8-r35`** (tip `645fd4989`, tree `b2ba2bb32c76e857`) folded the bounded pinned
host-expert pool into block 06 (plus the `mul_mat_vec_q_moe` row-tail clamp in block 13).  The pool is an
**option** (the default stays `pinned`); it sizes to `MOE_HOST_POOL_MIB`, auto = 25 % of the MoE host
expert bytes.  Before that,
**`v16-a55e952b8-r34`** (tip `40ce2ab86`, tree `a253691093acbd96`) deferred block 12's NCCL init to the
first large tensor: the hybrid
all-reduce already served every decode-sized reduce through the internal pipeline, but an eager
`ncclCommInitAll` degraded it ~3x (`-sm tensor -ncmoe 0` decode 21.6 -> **69.5 t/s**, output unchanged),
so NCCL now comes up lazily on the first prefill tensor.  Before it, **`v16-a55e952b8-r33`** (tip
`6e567349cfb237f9`, tree `13479e6ae709ce53`) removed the pageable host-expert master (issue #116);
`--host-experts mmap`
and the legacy `LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS` are dropped -- a no-XNACK GPU (gfx1201 reports `XNACK enabled:
NO`) cannot read a pageable address in a kernel, so `-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` experts are always pinned
(`ROCm_Host`).  The cache gains the matching safety rails (the in-place alias requires a successful
`cudaHostGetDevicePointer`; the device gather declines a master with no device mapping; a partial
pageable axis-0 `-sm tensor` split declines) and `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB` in `(0, 2048)` now hard-aborts
(`0` disables); the bounded pinned DIO host tier is opened as `archive/work/host-expert-dio-cache/`.  Strict 16/16
`git am`, `validate-set.sh` green.  Before it, **`v16-a55e952b8-r32`** fixed the two crashes found during
the PR #115 review (issue #48 in block 06, issue #49 in block 15).  Before that,
**`v16-a55e952b8-r31`** folded
**PR #115 into block 06** (the MoE expert-cache decode/verify band follows the routed-expert MMVQ band,
16 tokens on RDNA4 / 8 on RDNA3 and NVIDIA, via a single-owner `moe_cache_band` backend hook, plus the
device-side admission fill-list fix), and carried the untagged r31 test-only GDN-accuracy coverage fix.
The predecessor release **`v16-a55e952b8-r30`** was
**issue #113 root-caused and fixed -- the BF16/WMMA chunked GDN default is back ON** (the r29 KLD was an
`A_sc` stride aliasing bug for `n_seqs > 1`, not bf16 precision; fixed in both GDN kernel files, mean
KLD 0.000707 / 0.000052 / 0.000150 on gfx1201 / gfx1100 / gfx1151, prefill bf16 vs fp32 +4-8 %).
The release before it **`v16-a55e952b8-r29`** flipped the path off as a workaround; **`v16-a55e952b8-r28`** folded the **`--host-experts` flag into block
06**: the `-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` host-expert backing is now a first-class `--host-experts <pinned|mmap|auto>` option
(public `llama_model_params.host_experts_mode`; default pinned; the legacy `LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS` env is
kept).  1x R9700 (35B-A3B Q4_K_M, `-ncmoe 40`): `--host-experts mmap` is ~5 % slower prefill / ~0.5 %
decode and drops peak RSS 40.7 -> 22.2 GB by removing the ~18.6 GB non-swappable `ROCm_Host` expert set;
greedy text byte-identical, strict 16/16 `git am`, `validate-set.sh` green.  The predecessor release was
**`v16-a55e952b8-r27`**: **PR #114 folded into block 15** -- four bit-identical
qwen4exp decode fusions, each with a default-on `=0` kill-switch: the latency-scheduled BF16 `hc_mix`
up/collapse (`GGML_HC_UP_V2=0`), `HC_COMBINE` folded into that norm (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_HC_COMBINE_MIX=0`),
the shared-expert `sigmoid`-`mul`-`add` gate (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_SIGMOID_MUL_ADD=0`), and the GDN `beta`
sigmoid folded into the sequential kernel (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GDN_BETA_SIGMOID=0`).  On this box: the `HC_MIX`
op +4-21 % (nt 1..8), end-to-end qwen4exp decode **+2.4 %** with byte-identical text; `HC_MIX 30/30`,
`GATED_DELTA_NET 46/46`, dense 4B same-seed unchanged, warning-free build.  Builds on the **r26**
(**PR #107** DFlash F1 default-on, **PR #110** DPP wave32 warp butterflies) and **r25** (**PR #106 folded
into blocks 06/08/14/15, minus its patch 0002**, plus `TODO #45`) releases.  Its predecessors: **`v16-a55e952b8-r24`** (the MoE expert-cache floor
decides early again, plus the cache/arena repack into block 06), **`v16-a55e952b8-r23`** (diagnostics hygiene),
**`v16-a55e952b8-r22`** (the **movable-boundary slab allocator**) and **`v16-a55e952b8-r21`** (the OPEN 1

0002, plus `TODO #45`.**  Eight of the nine PR #106 (`@briansp2020`, issue #105) patches are folded where the
code lives: 0001 into block 08 (retired Q8_1 input arenas stay alive for captured graphs -- the

**Previous release - `v16-a55e952b8-r24` (2026-10-07):** two things.  (a) **The MoE expert-cache floor
decides early again** -- `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIN_MIB` corrupted a run (MTP acceptance 0.00874 where the
streaming path gives 0.91797) because the early preflight walked `model->devices` (the **Meta** device under
`-sm tensor`) while `moe_host_expert_bytes` is keyed by the **real** device, so the hook never ran and only
the LATE check applied -- and a late `g_enabled = false` flips the global fusion gate after graphs are
planned, so the MTP draft and the target took different kernels.  The preflight now walks the host-expert
map and runs **before the context** (before any graph), and a late trip only logs an ERROR.
`_MIN_RES_PCT` was silently inert before and works now.  (b) **The whole cache + arena/slab subsystem moved
from blocks 13/14/15 into block 06** (the system-operations bucket) with blocks 07-15 rebased onto it -- a
pure attribution repack with **zero code change**, proven by the final tree being byte-identical to the
pre-repack tree.  Canonical block-15 tip `46701e3ff`, net tree
`1a580f937447949e27f4f822b19714c1c8ebb826` (strict 16/16 `git am`, `validate-set.sh` green); gates:
acceptance 0.92448, rule-0 0.53519 = 1848/3453, server wide1 -> short -> wide2 **0 aborts** with the arena
restored.  See `WORKLOG.md` 2026-10-07 (r24) and `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/repack/`.

**Previous release - `v16-a55e952b8-r23` (2026-10-07):** diagnostics hygiene from the r22 field run.  Six
unconditional `MMB_*` `fprintf(stderr, ...)` diagnostics are gated on the file's existing
`GGML_CUDA_MMB_LOG` (A/B: 0 lines by default, 83 with the gate on); `ggml_cuda_slab_extend` reports the
free VRAM measured AFTER its mapping (it claimed "6.18 GiB left free" where the truth was the 4.06 GiB
headroom); the stale-alias guard reports its running count; and the teardown compute-buffer size check
only warns when the current size EXCEEDS the reservation (the post-prefill drop now refreshes
`backend_buf_exp_size`, so a legitimate mid-run shrink is a DEBUG line).  No behaviour change: DoD
`-ub 8192` cache-auto 16k decode **74.4 t/s** / prefill **1695 t/s** with MTP acceptance **0.92448**
(bit-identical to r22), rule-0 acceptance **0.53519 = 1848/3453** (bit-identical), server
wide1 -> short -> wide2 **0 aborts** with the arena restored.  Same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical

folds into block 15.

**Previous release - `v16-a55e952b8-r22` (2026-10-07):** the **movable-boundary slab allocator** -- ONE
slab per device, reserved and mapped exactly once and split by a movable boundary (compute buffer below,
MoE arena above), so a wide prefill and a large arena coexist and **HIP is never called at runtime**.
It ends the TODO #42 server abort and makes the wide-prefill drop default-on for **every** tool
(field-validated: `-ub 6144 -c 204800`, 2 GPU `-sm tensor -ncmoe 48`, a 30k-token prompt after a
45k-token generation -- 0 aborts, prefill 1445 t/s, decode back to 68-71 t/s, the drop re-arming the
arena to 38854.7 MiB).  Canonical tip `562e06f81`, net tree `c0927a3ea887588564f7fa1b354d773871a20b6f`.

**Previous release (2026-10-06) - `v16-a55e952b8-r21`:** the OPEN 1 safety subset.  A silent r20 corruption
is fixed -- the r19 arena slot-count retry shrank an arena but left `t.slots` at the requested count, so
the table over-read its allocation; the arena is now allocated per **layer** as a unit (a shortfall
re-sizes the whole layer down instead of one table), `MTP_DRAFT_N_UBATCH` defaults to **512**, and the
wide-prefill drop is default **on for `llama-cli` only** (`-ub 8192` cache-auto 16k decode **78.7 t/s**
/ prefill **1683 t/s**, coherent).  A server must leave the drop off (it cannot reclaim a contiguous
~12.4-12.9 GB layout), so the `llama-server` DoD remains open (OPEN 2).  Same fork point `a55e952b8`;

**Earlier release `v16-a55e952b8-r16`:** blocks 16 and 17 fix the `-sm tensor` +
host-resident-expert `////` corruption family.  Block 16: the meta staging consume repointed the device
tensor at the ring slot and the stage guard restored the pointer before the kernels executed, so the
staged bytes were never read; the slot is now copied into the real buffer (`stage_d2d`) and the generic
ring's `stage_mode` defaults to 0.  Block 17: the tensor-split pruned upload distributed its guard as a
contiguous prefix along the split axis, so only device 0 ever received it and devices 1..N-1's
speculative MMQ tail read uninitialised memory; every device now gets its own guard.  Full record:
`WORKLOG.md` (top) and `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/TENSOR-CORRUPTION.md`; patch `source-guard-fix.patch`.

**Previous release `v16-a55e952b8-r15` (2026-10-06):** blocks 06 and 13 are amended.
Under `-sm tensor` a repeating layer's device is the **Meta** device, and once the host buffer types
are per device (r14's block-06 change) the Meta device's `get_host_buffer_type` returns null, so the
`-ncmoe` experts fell back to the pageable `CPU_REPACK` buffer (not `is_host`) and the scheduler's
op-offload device pin skipped the Meta backend -- every host expert op ran on the **CPU**.  **Block 06**
now prefers a real device's pinned host buft (`LLAMA_TENSOR_HOST_BUFT=0` restores `CPU_REPACK`) and
accepts a Meta device that contains the weight's buffer device (`meta_dev_contains`); **block 13** skips
the cache's device-side admission policy (and its prefill seed) for split tables
(`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_DEVPOLICY_SPLIT=1` restores), which is what made the cache slow under a Meta split.

Contributor PR #104 (@briansp2020), fixing issue #103.  **Block 06** (`ggml-backend.cpp`) orders a
cross-device split-input copy after the destination backend's queued work: the copy runs on the
source backend's stream, so it was not ordered after the outbound copy of an earlier split's output,
which the allocator may have overwritten with the new input (the `!!!!` prefill output with
`-sm layer` on 2 GPUs and host experts).  **Block 13** (`moe-expert-cache.cu`) adds
`alias_find_checked`, which trusts a `g_alias_to_id` pointer alias only when the table is on the

host; with `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB` armed this frees the draft's device expert copies (draft compute

`GGML_SCHED_STAGE=0` are untouched.  Verified on gfx1201: the calibration log is absent for a dense
full-offload 4B and present for a gemma-4-26B-A4B `-ncmoe 99` prefill; dense and `-ncmoe` same-seed
greedy are byte-identical to r7; the dense 3-GPU `-sm tensor` 4B gate `1c5d32ac537d` is unchanged.

**Previous release on `main` (2026-10-05) - `v16-a55e952b8-r7`:** issue #93 amends **blocks 06 and

qwen4exp's 450 MiB host-resident expert tables overflowed the fixed 2048 MiB
`GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MAX_MB` default, so the fifth slot growth disabled staging for the rest of the run
(the reporter's trace: 30 % H2D, 0 % overlap; a bigger ring gave +42 % at `-ub 2048` on PCIe5 x16).
The budget is now auto-sized from the largest slot when the variable is unset, the width gate is
scaled by `host_table_bytes / 144 MiB` (`GGML_SCHED_STAGE_TABLE_REF_MB` overrides; `0` disables),
a shortfall skips the split instead of disabling the ring, and the raw arena is counted in
`llama_get_memory_breakdown` / `--fit`.  The device gather is untouched and stays default-off.

`ggml_add_backend()` only publishes `GGML_USE_<backend>` on the `ggml` target when
`GGML_BACKEND_DL=OFF`, and the published containers build with `-DGGML_BACKEND_DL=ON` (needed for
`GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS`), so `src/llama-arch.cpp`'s `#ifdef GGML_USE_HIP` compiled to the
HIP-absent branch there and the qwen4exp tensor-split gate rejected `-sm tensor`
(`LLAMA_SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR not implemented for architecture 'qwen4exp'`) even though the HIP backend
was built.  `ggml/src/ggml-hip/CMakeLists.txt` now also publishes `GGML_USE_HIP` on `ggml`, so the
macro reaches the main libraries in both modes; the static build already had it and is unchanged.
Verified on a local `GGML_BACKEND_DL=ON` configure matching the Dockerfile (before: no
`GGML_USE_HIP` on `llama`; after: the `LLM_ARCH_QWEN4EXP` case preprocesses to `return true`).  See

1-row decode-band consumer and never filled; qwen4exp's unmasked MTP export hit this and the wide
op read stale bytes, NaN-ing `t_h_nextn` and collapsing MTP draft acceptance.  The fix re-registers
the weights as an input of the later split so they are staged for its routing; single-consumer

**Previous release `v16-84e76d8a2-r37`:** the BF16 hyper-connection mixer
fusion (contributor PR #91, @briansp2020) is folded into **block 15**.  The ISTA-DASLab GSQ-RCO quants
keep `hc_{attn,ffn}_{down,up,inject}` in BF16, and block 14's fused `GGML_OP_HC_MIX` was Q8_0-only, so
those models ran the six-dispatch unfused chain (rms×gamma, down `mul_mat_vec_f`, scale+silu, up
`mul_mat_vec_f_vb`, `dsv4_hc_pre`, inject `mul_mat_vec_f`), 96 mixers per token on a dispatch-bound
decode.  The new BF16 arm replays that chain in three dispatches with the same per-thread K order and
reductions (bit-identical); it is not a precision/memory trade (the weights are already BF16) and no
weights are converted.  It engages only for GPU-resident BF16 hc weights at `hc_lr == 320`;
`LLAMA_HC_MIX_BF16=0` keeps the chain.  The CPU `HC_MIX` reference gained the matching BF16 arm, and the

**Previous release on `main` (2026-10-05) - `v16-84e76d8a2-r36`:** the issue **#89** indexer top-k
block-path fix (contributor PR #90) is folded into **block 15**.  The fused indexer top-k's block fast
path (`indexer_topk_radix_cuda_blocks` in `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/indexer-topk.cu`) ran radix pass 1 at cell
level, passes 2-4 at block level and the gather at cell level; each hist-block owns blocks
`[h*bchunk, (h+1)*bchunk)` in the block passes but cells `[h*bchunk*r, (h+1)*bchunk*r)` in the gather,
so the histogram-derived per-range `g_cnt`/`e_cnt` bases were only correct when block `b` occupied cells
`[b*r, b*r+r)`.  A unified KV holding several sequences (blocks keyed by (sequence, position bucket)),
or a single sequence whose KV head has moved past cell 0, broke that: output entries were left
unwritten or overwritten, and `flash_attn_qsa` then gathered K/V at stale out-of-range indices (GPU
page fault, server hang) or silently attended to the wrong cells.  A new
`indexer_topk_count_cells_grouped` kernel recounts `g_cnt`/`e_cnt` over exactly the cell ranges the
gather walks after the last radix pass, with the gather's key logic; the per-row radix totals (and the
selection threshold) were already partition-independent and the block-level passes are kept.  A new
`INDEXER_TOPK` backend-op case (`test_indexer_topk_block`) builds the op directly with a from-cell-0
control, a one-sequence offset map and a two-stream unified-KV map, and **fails on the unfixed r35

**#59:** qsa3 is off on RDNA3_0 by default (`GGML_CUDA_QSA3=1` opts in, `=0` force-off), and a packed QSA
op's support equals the qsa3 predicate, so the qwen4exp graph probes the backend and skips the two
natural-F16 K/V packs it would otherwise only waste (RDNA3_5/RDNA4 defaults unchanged).  **#60:** the
4-head lightning-indexer prefill score is supported on RDNA3_0 again, and `build_qsa_top_k`'s `use_wmma`
takes the fused op once the score exceeds `LLAMA_QSA_SCORE_WMMA_MB` MiB (default 64, `0` = always fused)
and keeps the faster chain below it; the chain's `mul_mat+relu` and its chunked form now use
`ggml_relu_inplace` (bit-identical, removes the 2x-score reserve peak).  Also counts the FA prefill
staging arena in `llama_get_memory_breakdown`/`--fit` (issue #33 follow-up).  Candidate gates on gfx1100:

one-time expert-head zero (guarding the quantized `MUL_MAT_ID` MMQ's speculative over-read) was hard-coded
to 64 bytes - the *IQ4_NL* threshold the beta5 session measured, not a quant-independent one - so
**IQ4_XS** over-read further and the stale NaN bytes poisoned the tile (on one GPU as well as multi-GPU;
the beta5 gates only used IQ4_NL / Q8_0 / Q4_K_M).  The gather now uses the host path's
`min(expert_size, 512)` and keys the one-time zero on `(input_cpy buffer, expert_bytes)`.  Prefill

`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=<MiB>` - unset, every entry point is a no-op and the build is bit-identical to r28 -
and keeps the hot experts in a persistent per-device VRAM arena over the pinned host expert pool (LFRU
admission, UVA cold reads, device-side remap with pipelined promotion, on-GPU admission policy,
prompt-routing seed), so `-ncmoe` decode approaches fully-resident speed while prefill still streams from

**Previous release on `main` (2026-09-30) - `v16-84e76d8a2-r28`:** a **block-15 amendment fixing the VMM
pool free-order abort** (issue #76, PR #77 by overdoingism).  `ggml_cuda_pool_vmm` requires `free()` in the
reverse of the allocation order and `ggml_cuda_pool_alloc` destroys in reverse declaration order, so
`kq_blocks` (the issue-#48 fully-masked-group bitmap) was declared after `dst_tmp`/`dst_tmp_meta` even though
it is allocated before them; a batch that also needed `dst_tmp_meta` (fractional stream-k tiles, or
`parallel_blocks > 1`) then freed `kq_blocks` out of stack order and aborted in `ggml_cuda_pool_vmm::free`
right after prompt processing.  Only a VMM-enabled build (`GGML_HIP_NO_VMM=OFF`) shows it; the legacy pool
(the HIP default) does not check the order, and `GGML_CUDA_FA_MASK_SKIP=0` was the workaround.  The fix only
moves the declaration.  Reproduced and fixed on gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14 with a `-DGGML_HIP_NO_VMM=OFF` build:
`test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` aborts on its first case before the fix and passes **6354/6354** after

**Previously, release `v16-84e76d8a2-r27` (2026-09-30):** a **block-15 amendment collecting four
contributor PRs and the issue-#71 RDNA4 rows fix**.  **PR #68** (briansp2020) folds the dense FFN
`silu(gate) * up` into the mmq down-projection quantize (bit-exact; `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_SWIGLU_MMQ=0` off).
**PR #73** (overdoingism) keeps the DFlash target's layer features on the device for a single sequence
(`GGML_LF_DFLASH_DEV=1`; kept opt-in pending a model-level gate).  **PR #74** (overdoingism) replaces the
ksplit mmvq verify epilogue's per-output butterflies with a template-recursive halving reduce (bit-identical;
one-wave blocks only).  **PR #75** (briansp2020) adds the qwen4exp `HC_MIX` band-up / prequantized-down-tail /
register-`rms_gamma` kernels plus general RDNA4 1-token 2-row dense mmvq, F32 mmvf, `apply_ksigns`, an
IQ2_XS MoE unroll and the IQ2_XS/IQ3_XXS routed-compact mmq bands (the latter gated to RDNA4, so gfx1151
keeps its source-of-record plain path).  **Issue #71** returns 1 row for `ncols_dst >= 2 && nwarps > 1`,

**Previously, release `v16-84e76d8a2-r26` (2026-09-30):** the **block-06 amendment** fixes the r12
op-offload H2D staging ring (issue #50): `GGML_SCHED_EVENTS` defaulted OFF, so with a single graph copy
`wait_before_overwrite()` became a full device synchronize (measured 1858 calls / 5.2 s in one single-R9700
8K prefill pass at `-ub 8192`), and `if (split->n_inputs > sched->stage_n_slots)` skipped merged routed-MoE
bands (31 inputs: one 450 MiB expert weight plus ~30 tiny view/ids inputs), so the weight took the serial
host path.  The amendment counts host-weight inputs for that gate, defaults the events ON
(`GGML_SCHED_EVENTS=0` opts out) and enqueues a host->device split-input copy asynchronously after an
in-stream event wait (`event_wait != NULL` gate, so the Meta backend keeps its buffer copy).  Delivery-only

**Previously, release `v16-84e76d8a2-r25` (2026-09-29):** **block 15** makes the address-gated
`ROPE -> VIEW -> SET_ROWS` fusion **bit-transparent**, fixing the cross-start Q6_K greedy flip of issue #67
(from #58 item D).  A canonicalised per-graph allocation-plan dump is byte-identical with the fusion on vs
off (so the `add_alloc_deps` pass needs no rope entry); the cause was clang contracting the fused
`<float,__half>` and unfused `<float,float>` rope template instantiations differently (both computed the
f16-midpoint float `beb67000` for one element of the 256x1024 prefill K-cache write, yet stored -0.3562 vs
-0.3564).  `#pragma clang fp contract(off)` at the top of `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/rope.cu` makes every rope
instantiation round identically: default and `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_ROPE_SET_ROWS=1` now both give W=1 hash

**Previously, release `v16-84e76d8a2-r20` (2026-09-28):** two amendments to **blocks 10

RDNA4/RDNA3_0 and band-uniform across `W = 1..8`; the 2026-09-12 revert that removed it was aimed at
Q4_K/Q5_K's `vdr4` (32/call) and took Q6_K down unmeasured.  On the reporter's models `llama-batched-bench`
`B=8` moves 74.29 -> **86.61 t/s** (Q6_K) and 83.68 -> **85.89** (`Swift-Q5_K_M`), `W=1` flat-to-positive,
prefill unchanged.  (2) The graph-cache predicate no longer treats the fixed-shape spec-verify widths
(2..8) as prefill, and the cache is keyed per `(first node, n_tokens)`, so verify batches keep HIP graph
replay (+16-19 % on Windows/ROCm 10, ~+1 % on Linux/ROCm 7.14; `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_VERIFY_GRAPHS=1` is the
kill switch).  Canonical tip `8fe002a16`, tree `6f8369bf06aa54afa7470e204fef2ac7ae6e8853`.  Strict

**Previously, release `v16-84e76d8a2-r19` (2026-09-28):** a **block-06** amendment that stops the
**offloaded-MoE decode from being serialised**.  r17's tiny-CPU-graph heuristic exempted `MUL_MAT_ID`'s
src0 (the whole expert table) from its byte count, so every `-ncmoe` decode graph measured "tiny" and ran on
one thread.  That measurement was taken with the worker pool on the cores this host pins its **GPU IRQs** to
(`pin_gpu_irqs.sh`: the top `NUM_GPUS` cores; 13/14/15 with 3x R9700), so it was an artefact of the default
`-t 16` -- the same thread count on one CCD is 36.0 t/s, `-t 12` is 38.6, and `--poll 0` changes nothing.
A graph whose `MUL_MAT_ID` weights are host-resident but not in the CPU backend's buffer type (the
`-ncmoe` signature) is not tiny in work, so it now runs multi-threaded and **capped at
`max(1, hardware_concurrency()/2)`**, overridable with `GGML_CPU_MOE_OFFLOAD_THREADS` (`0` = uncapped;
above the default warns once).  Canonical tip `16977e9d16aacaa430535a98e8d9cb84efb4b910`, tree

**Previously, release `v16-84e76d8a2-r18` (2026-09-28):** a **block-13** amendment making the
qwen35moe SSM gate/beta fusion width-uniform.  Block 08's decode-only `ggml_cuda_op_ssm_gate_beta` pinned
plain `calc_nwarps()` while block 13's standalone dense mmvq weight launch uses `calc_nwarps_weight()`
(8 warps for Q8_0 with `K < 4096`), so W = 1 (fused) and W >= 2 (unfused) reduced K differently and the
delivered `-ncmoe` path was not `plain == draft-mtp` pure.  It now uses
`calc_nwarps_weight(..., long_k = ne[0] >= 4096)` -- a no-op for long K -- so the fusion is bit-identical

`select_weight_buft`'s "avoid using a host buffer when using mmap" downgrade is now skipped for
`MUL_MAT_ID` weights — the tensors op-offload (`-ncmoe`) H2D-uploads every ubatch — so those uploads read
**pinned** memory instead of the pageable model mapping (which on ROCm blocks the host inside
`hipMemcpyAsync` and makes the meta backend's 2-D spliced upload fault).  Default on,

**Previous release (2026-09-25) — `v16-84e76d8a2-r4`:** a block-15 amendment.  The RDNA4 head-256
GQA-6 decode/verify FA band (`n_q <= 8`) now runs the WMMA kernel with the GQA group folded into one
block (`ncols2 = 8`) and the KV split round-robin over a fixed `P = nsm` blocks, instead of the tile
kernel's `ncols2 = 2`, which fetched and dequantized every K/V element once per head pair (3x at GQA
6).  Covers every native quantized K/V type (q8_0/q4_0/q4_1/q5_0/q5_1/iq4_nl), is default on

**Previous release (2026-09-25) — `v16-84e76d8a2-r3`:** a block-14 amendment + beta re-base.  The
qwen4exp CPU `hc_combine` reference (`ggml_compute_forward_hc_combine_f32`) indexed `block_out` with
`t*ne[1]` and `inject` with `t*hc` instead of each tensor's own `nb[1]` row stride, so every
multi-token fused ubatch read the wrong rows; a CPU-resident qwen4exp decoder layer then emitted EOS
as its first generated token (issue #44, gfx1100).  The reference now mirrors the CUDA kernel's
stride semantics (0 for a broadcast `ne[1] == 1`) and is bit-identical at nt == 1.  Validated with
an op-level CPU-vs-HIP oracle (7/8 multi-token cases FAIL pre-fix, 8/8 PASS post-fix).  Strict 16/16
`git am` on a fresh `84e76d8a2` tarball (applied tree `08fe2b77…`).  The 28-patch beta set is re-based
onto r3 (applied tree `0daefe22…`), and beta patch 0027 now restricts the 16-wide routed
`mul_mat_vec_q_moe` band to RDNA4 (RDNA3_0 failed `MUL_MAT_ID` 23/929, RDNA3_5 is a measured loss).

**Previous release (2026-09-25) — `v16-84e76d8a2-r2`:** a block-10 amendment.  The wide-VDR MoE expert
entry points (`VDR_Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K_Q8_1_MMVQ_MOE` = 4/4/2) were unconditional while only the Q8_0 MoE
VDR was arch-gated, so RDNA3_5 (gfx115x) - where the block-10 comment says it "keeps VDR=2 pending
verification" - ran the Q4_K/Q6_K experts (the Q4_K_M expert types) with the wide chunk.
`get_vec_dot_q_cuda()`/`get_vdr_mmvq()` now ignore `moe` on every target that is not RDNA4/RDNA3_0,
one gate for both selectors; RDNA4/RDNA3_0 keep the measured VDR=4.  Base-16 MoE `draft-mtp n3`

**Previous release (2026-09-22) — `v16-ebbb18522-r13`:** a block-00 amendment on top of r12 that folds
in the shared-NextN MTP fix.  A `nextn_shared_target_tensors` head (no `token_embd`/`output` of its
own, e.g. the qwen4exp `mtp-…-shared-Q8_0.gguf` sidecar) borrows the target's tensors, which sets
`ctx_other`; the MTP draft driver inferred KV sharing from that pointer and took the gemma4
same-position arm, so every draft round past the first died on the M-RoPE `X < Y` check.  `is_mem_shared`
is now gated on the `gemma4-assistant` arch.  Upstream bug (`04eb4c446`, #23398); block 00 is the home
because it must precede every later block.  Canonical tip
`8491bf2bff8eb3a56e5120c3c9c17533a94ea6bf`, tree `bb7b6d07b05ad8e23ab6e770172e7f597cfb3c12`.

**r12 (2026-09-21) — `v16-ebbb18522-r12`:** a block-15 amendment on top of r11, promoting
`beta/tensor-fit-fix/`: **`--fit` now supports `-sm tensor`**.  Upstream threw
`llama_params_fit is not implemented for SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR` and `common_fit_params()` swallowed the
exception, so the default-**on** `--fit` never ran under tensor split and users had to size
`-c`/`-ngl`/`-ts` by hand.  The Meta device's accessors are exposed (they existed upstream, file-static)
and `common/fit.cpp` gained a dedicated tensor path: per-device targets from `--fit-target`, a
proportional split or an honoured user `-ts` (with the binding `effective budget` logged), then an auto
`n_ctx` reduction and an `-ngl` binary search, never overriding an explicit `-c`.  **Block 06** is the home:
the delivery's general system-operations bucket (already carrying the r6 FA instance build-time work
upstream), and the change depends on no block - `common/fit.cpp`, `ggml/include/ggml-backend.h` and
`docs/multi-gpu.md` are untouched by every block and the Meta accessors already exist upstream
(file-static); it
remains a good `upstream/` PR candidate.  Re-validated on r11: the default fit cases reproduce the
2026-09-18 record exactly, the `-ngl`-reduction cases are more conservative (the fit now sizes for the
packed mask r11 restored for M-RoPE), seven end-to-end loads generate with zero out-of-memory and zero
compute-buffer growth (including the separate-MTP-head `draft-mtp-adaptive` path), and the same-seed gate
is byte-identical.  Canonical tip `54f8a57fc50344f738c363c13b243a0ad81f70da`, tree

**r11 (2026-09-20) — `v16-ebbb18522-r11`:** a block-15 amendment (issue #42) on top of r10:
the compute reserve now measures with the packed kq mask when one is **reachable**, because V3's derived
form is a per-*batch* optimization — a 2-D M-RoPE image/audio batch or a multi-sequence batch allocates
the packed mask (`n_kv*n_tokens*2`), which the reserve (measured with the derived form on) did not
contain.  A deep-context image batch therefore grew the compute buffer mid-run and, under the default
`--fit-target 256`, died with `cudaMalloc failed: out of memory` -> `failed to process mtmd chunk`; the
next request then asserted on the state the failed reserve left behind.  `sched_reserve()` now measures
with the packed mask only where such a batch is reachable (the new `kq_mask_packed_reachable()`: M-RoPE
or `n_seq_max > 1`; every other packed-mask source already keeps the mask in the reserve), so `--fit`
counts it exactly where it can happen.  Same-seed greedy output is byte-identical and throughput is
unchanged; the reporter's M-RoPE model pays 8960 tokens / -4.4 % of fitted context, while a non-M-RoPE
single-sequence model keeps V3's reserve untouched.  A failed buffer allocation additionally invalidates
the allocator's layout, so a remaining OOM is a clean `GGML_STATUS_ALLOC_FAILED` rather than an assert.

**r10 (2026-09-20) — `v16-ebbb18522-r10`:** a block-11 amendment (issue #41) on top of r9:
the pre-fill test now reads the real token count (`ggml_cuda_graph_is_multi_token()`), so the leading
expert tensor (`[n_ff, n_expert_used, 1]`) of a split-MoE `-ncmoe` one-token decode split no longer
misclassifies it as pre-fill and decode replays HIP graphs again (0 -> 50 warmups / 0 -> 687 replays,
`tg` 10.6 -> 12.8 t/s on Qwen3.8-Flash-Next UD-Q4_K_XL, output bit-identical); on HIP the exec is
destroyed/re-instantiated instead of updated to avoid the ROCm <= 10.0 `hipGraphExecUpdate` leak
(`GGML_HIP_GRAPH_FORCE_UPDATE=1` opt-out).  Canonical tip

16/16.  **r9** was a block-15 amendment on top of r8 — the V3derived kq mask is now implemented in the **tile** FA kernel as well, so the head-cap configurations
(gemma4 head 512 on gfx1100/gfx1151) that r8 could only *report* now get it, as a deep-prefill win with
decode unchanged (the derived branch is hoisted out of the KV loop, because decode/verify always take
the tile kernel).  Earlier releases on this base: **r8** made the derived-mask disable self-explanatory (block 15;
superseded by r9's fix for the cause it named); **r7** fixed V3's derived-mask kernel shape (issue #30,
block 15); **r6** the FA instance build-time fix (blocks 06/13/15; clean `ggml-hip -j16` 323 -> 236 s);
**r5** the block-04 gfx1100 WMMA FA head cap (issue #30); **r4** the block-04 RDNA3_0 tensor-split
`ncols2` fix (issue #30: 2× RX 7900 XTX `pp100K` 667.5 -> 779.4 t/s, stock 805.0), on top of **r3**
(block-01 `--fit` SIGSEGV with `draft-mtp-adaptive` and a minimal per-tier MTP head, issue #38).  See
`WORKLOG.md` and `patches/README.md` per release.

**Re-base (2026-09-17) — release `v16-ebbb18522-r2`:** the 16-block set re-based onto
upstream master `ebbb18522` (37 commits past `d1d3c3396`).  Three blocks needed resolution: block 02
(the `GATED_DELTA_NET` op-param clone in the Vulkan check-results moved to the new
`ggml-vulkan-debug.cpp`), block 12 (upstream #27825 enabled the CUDA internal AllReduce on HIP; the
delivery keeps its HIP split, so `allreduce.cu` stays CUDA-only and the HIP hybrid lives in
`allreduce-hip.cu`), and block 14 (upstream #28901 added the qwen4exp hc ops; the delivery's
decode-band fused hc ops keep the `nt <= 8` band and upstream's `ggml_dsv4_hc_pre_gated`/`post`
serve prefill — plus the pair-fusion `ncols_opt` gate broadened to `RDNA3` for gfx1151 consistency
with upstream #28935).  Canonical tip `31b1790372d17bf7f95f3e15f7b4e2b35eb661e1`, tree

**Re-base (2026-09-15) — the current release `v16-d1d3c3396-r1`:** the 16-block set re-based onto
upstream master `d1d3c3396` (51 commits past `790cf51aa`).  Three conflict files: block 00's Vulkan
masked-V fix composed with upstream's sparse FA (`fc82583e6`); the FA test matrix (`1e7bcf3da` +
block 03's `112`); and qwen4exp's `{n_embd, hc}` norm fold (`41abbfd59`), where the MTP head's
`nextn.hc_head_norm` also had to move to `{n_embd, hc}` (a reservation-only `ggml_can_repeat` crash
that validation caught).  Canonical tip `af9ce375ded5238b59598290ad7366760b7dc6e0`, tree

**Block-15 amendment (2026-09-15, build time) — the previous release `v16-790cf51aa-r5`:** the tile
kernel's native-KV type axis is instantiated in the 12 generated instance TUs again instead of
implicitly in the dispatch TU.  Block 03 made `type_KV` a template parameter of
`ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_tile_case` while `DECL_FATTN_TILE_CASE`/`EXTERN_DECL_FATTN_TILE_CASES` kept
covering only F16/BF16, so — the dispatch having an unconditional `case` per native type — the other
six types were compiled into the dispatch TU (72 of its 96 `tile_case` symbols).  That one TU took
**509 s of a 538 s** clean `-j16` backend build; the macros now expand per type, so the generated files
carry 8 cases each and the dispatch only externs: **538 s -> 330 s**, `fattn-tile.cu` **509 s -> < 10
s**, with byte-identical kernels (FA test 5951/5951; 27B text hashes unchanged; per-type perf within
0.12 %).  The remaining critical path is the `fattn-mma-f16` instance set, which the same delivery grew
8x (0.90 -> 7.26 MB, 6.7 -> 229 s per TU) — diagnosed, follow-up in `TODO.md`.

**Block-15 amendment (2026-09-15, issue #30 second round) — r4:**
(1) the mixed-K/V kernel contract — the tile kernel's one `type_KV` vs the launcher's per-tensor native
read, which made a mixed pair read raw q4_0 as F16 (the reporter's 4 NaN failures); (2) the
`get_alloc_size` TILE case never learned the q4_0 arm, so the arm's memory win was never delivered
(`-c 196608` q4_0 849 -> **123 MiB**); (3) the prefill band split + the per-context, per-stream staging
arena + the RDNA3_5 arch gate (TODO 21: gfx1201 q8_0 `pp150000` 691/1077/1199 on 1/2/3 GPU, from
661/996/1111; the arena is also the adaptive-MTP `-c 196608` load fix); (4) native arms for
`q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1`/`iq4_nl` (TODO 2: tg64 @ d32768 +9-13 % on gfx1201, +22-27 % on gfx1151).

The previous regeneration was 2026-09-12 (13): canonical 15-block tip `d306d4b4b194738dd5baad89ef77fa31a931e8ff` (net tree `3b0874b6aa367fea846a437b45f1689bd173b38c`), which amended block 14 (its 2026-09-12 (eighth) QSA indexer-score decode/verify band-uniformity fix).  **The block-15 patch was promoted on the old base** (it was the 17th beta re-cut: tip `f399b13494df50d44450b0a3960eb55f6952335b`, tree `c3142fe0b311757f458647f172f623859f5bc983`, strict `git am` round-trip).  The previous regeneration was 2026-09-12 (12) (tip `c6f1e8e78`, block 14's MTP-export logits-purity fix).  The regeneration
is always run against a canonical fork **rebuilt at the fork point**, because the reference
`~/llama.cpp` checkout had drifted two upstream master commits past `9113cc188` (`f3f1a8f27`,
`304665fe7` — SYCL + iGPU-only code) and a `format-patch` there would export those as patches
0001/0002; block `0000` is the structural/architecture-fix block added 2026-09-10 (FA small-batch
KV-split width invariance for issue #25 + Vulkan masked-V), block 01 was refreshed 2026-09-09 to the
llama.cpp PR #27210 review head `d236d41a2`, block 03 carries the HIP masked-V fixes (re-homed from
block 14 on 2026-09-10), block 06 is the host-buffer rationale marker (upstream itself reverted
#24233 in #28604, so the functional delta is upstream), and block 14's 2026-09-09 gfx1151-only
freed-cell KV host zeroing is removed.  **Block 15 (the attention-memory campaign, V3/V4/V5 + W1-W4)
is the last delivery patch** — promoted 2026-09-12 from
`archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/`; see that directory's README (PROMOTED) and the dated WORKLOG
entries.  The 2026-09-08 re-base reduced
block 06 to its host-buffer rationale marker (upstream itself reverted
#24233 in #28604 on 2026-09-08 — end state identical) and merged block
14's quantized-KV tensor-split gate additively with upstream #28390's
single-device `SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR` warn in `llama-context.cpp`; blocks
01-05 + 07-13 are content-identical to the previous `050dde50c`-based
delivery, whose regeneration `d65a96084..ce641322e` is superseded and
preserved on the fork's history/remotes); block 12 was amended
2026-09-04 with the runtime NCCL-failure fallback (issue #13) and again
2026-09-11 so the hybrid dispatch's small/large crossover is width-safe
(2-device `32768` -> `131072` elements - the size-based dispatch had been
changing the reduction algorithm with the batch width under `-sm tensor`),
block 13 was amended 2026-09-02 with two MTP regression fixes, 2026-09-05
with the RDNA3.5/RDNA3.0 gate relaxations and 2026-09-06 with the
model-neutral Strix MoE mmq folds and 2026-09-08 with the
moe_weighted_reduction float4 remainder fix (issue #19, reported by
briansp2020), block 14 (qwen4exp support) was
promoted from `beta/qwen4exp` 2026-09-07 and amended 2026-09-07 with
the QSA quantized-KV decode gate + the derived-cache pool gate,
2026-09-08 with the MUL_MAT_ID pair-fusion layout gate (issue #18,
reported by briansp2020), 2026-09-08 with the compiler-warning
cleanup (Vulkan/clang-16 + ROCm host builds) and 2026-09-08 with the
qwen4exp tensor-split backend gate (`#ifdef GGML_USE_HIP`) and
2026-09-08 with the quantized-KV tensor-split gate (an upstream
multi-GPU `SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR` abort for `q4_1`-family KV cache types;

History of the block structure: the work originated as 48 commits on the
fork's `chunked-gdn` branch (upstream `758443071`), decomposed into
functional blocks. Block numbering was compacted (2026-08-28): the k-quant
umbrella absorbed retired blocks 09 and 06, the set ran 01-11, and block 12
(hybrid all-reduce) was added as the delivery's final patch (2026-08-29).
Blocks 09 and 06 (old numbering) are retired: their content (Q6_K VDR=2
decode + the gfx1151 RDNA3_5 mmvq table) is folded into the k-quant umbrella
(block 10) so all k-quant VDR/decode work and all mmvq parameter-table
tuning lives in the one patch; excluding block 10 restores 100%
greedy-purity on ALL architectures on the K-split decode paths (12-block-era
claim; with block 13 installed, its rewritten short-K mmvq rows also deviate
from stock — see `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §9).

This is the authoritative apply order and the verification contract for the
patch set. It is written for humans AND LLM coding agents. Follow it exactly;
do not skip blocks.

Current state: `main` is the delivery branch (flat history, 16-patch set:
block 00 + blocks 01-15 against `ebbb18522`). The `baseline/<sha>` branches and `block/01-…11` tags
are HISTORICAL checkpoints of the old pre-block-12 structure (older
upstream ranges, `git apply` flow); do not use them for the current
delivery — use `patches/` + `scripts/apply-all.sh`.

Block numbers are the apply order: `01` applies first, `15` last. All blocks
are mutually independent except **block 08 (fused core) requires blocks 03
and 04 in the tree**. Apply the whole 01-15 series with `git am` (or
`scripts/apply-all.sh`) — the concatenated-series `git apply` trick
silently drops hunks.


## Verified apply sequence

### Block-15 attention-memory campaign wins (2026-09-10; promoted to the delivery 2026-09-12)

Block 15 is the RDNA memory campaign squashed into one block; it was promoted
to the delivery on 2026-09-12 as `patches/0015` and is now applied by
`scripts/apply-all.sh` together with blocks 00-14.  The record below is the
validation history (the "staged in `beta/`" wording reflects the beta window,
now closed).

Block 15 is the RDNA memory campaign squashed into one block.  It removes
compute-buffer VRAM and host buffer from the attention paths at
byte-identical output.  Six wins, each with an environment A/B gate
(V4 is an *enable* switch, default off); full mechanism notes and the
per-win measurement tables are in `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/README.md`.

Apply + regeneration verification (the `[PATCH NN/14]` / `ff2b35f49`
figures inside the bullets below are the then-current beta-staging state; the
promotion on 2026-09-12 made the delivery the 16-patch set `0000`-`0015`,
tip `0f4f83f9e`, tree `c3142fe0b311757f458647f172f623859f5bc983`):

- fresh worktree at `9113cc188` -> `scripts/apply-all.sh` (**strict 16/16
  `git am`** for the promoted 16-patch delivery, zero whitespace warnings,
  applied tree == canonical tree `c3142fe0b3`); the promoted `patches/0015`
  is byte-identical to `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/block-15-campaign-wins.patch`
  apart from its `From <sha>` line.  (During the beta window the same tree was
  validated by applying the 15-block delivery + the beta patch on top.)
- the delivered `0001`-`0014` files are byte-identical to the previous
  regeneration except the `From <sha>` line and the `[PATCH NN/14]` ->
  `[PATCH NN/15]` series count (verified hunk by hunk); `patches/0015` is the
  promoted block-15 patch.
- `rdna-boosts-all.patch` refreshed = `git diff 9113cc188..0f4f83f9e`
  (127 files; the block-15 promotion added the campaign delta to the net
  patch — blocks 00-14 are otherwise unchanged).

Combination validation (3x R9700/RDNA4; individually-validated wins do
NOT carry over, so this was re-run on the merged tree and then again on
the tree built from the delivered patches):

- **reserve matrix**, ctx 204800 / q8_0 KV, ub 2048/1024/512 x V4 off/on:
  qwen4exp ub 2048 **3251.39** MiB/GPU + **63.69** MiB host (pristine
  6690.40/1262.70; ub1024 1675.33/33.64, ub512 889.54/18.61) with the
  indexer KV at **318.76** MiB/GPU (was 956.26); 4B 1800.33/840.34 ->
  **1001.13**/41.13 -> **257.13** (V4); 27B 1920.33/880.34 ->
  **1121.13**/81.13 -> **489.13** (V4); gemma-4-E4B (ISWA)
  1887.35/935.37 -> 1078.17/126.19 -> 452.17; gemma-4-31B (ISWA)
  2753.35/897.36 -> 1942.18/86.18 -> 718.18.  Every number matches the
  per-win records; W1+W2+W3+V3+V4 compose additively.
- **coherence**: same-seed generated text **byte-identical** on 4B, 27B,
  gemma-4-E4B (ISWA), gemma-4-31B (ISWA) and qwen4exp across every gate
  combination (V3 x V4 on the dense models; W1/W2/W3/V3/V4 on qwen4exp)
  at a short and a 40k-token prompt.
- **adaptive-MTP gate unchanged**: 27B inline draft 0.76744 (66/86, mean
  3.28) identical in all four gate combinations; qwen4exp draft 0.44262
  (54/122) identical in all six gate combinations and equal to the
  block-14 baseline; MTP still +26 % over plain decode.
- **op suites**: FLASH_ATTN_EXT on ROCm0 (both V4 gates) and CPU (incl.
  the six derived cases), VIEW/CONT/CPY/DUP/CONCAT, `test-alloc`,
  `test-batch-alloc`; the W4 repro 56.00 -> 16.00 MiB and the revert
  restores `ggml-alloc.c` byte-identically.
- **prefill cost** (interleaved same-binary A/B, pp20480/ub 2048): V3
  -1.28 % (4B) / +0.28 % (27B); V4 a further -1.85 % (4B) / -1.72 %
  (27B); decode within noise.
- **V5 amendment (added 2026-09-10, re-validated end to end from the
  delivered patches)**: with a **bf16** KV cache and
  `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE=1` the F16 staging scratch is gone, so the
  reserve equals an f16 cache's -- 4B ub 2048 968.86 -> **256.86**
  MiB/GPU (ub 1024 884.82 -> 128.82, ub 512 842.80 -> 64.80), 27B
  1072.86 -> **488.86** (ub 512 868.80 -> 122.80), gemma-4-E4B
  1062.89 -> **404.89**, gemma-4-31B 2068.89 -> **716.89**; qwen4exp
  unchanged (f16 == bf16 == arm on/off), TILE/verify (ub 8) 8.09 either
  way; same-seed text byte-identical (on vs off vs f16, all models,
  short + 3k/40k prompts), MTP unchanged (27B 0.82716, qwen4exp 0.44262),
  `test-backend-ops` FLASH_ATTN_EXT 7859/7859 with the 2704 bf16 and 365
  q8_0 cases green in both arm states; cost bf16 prefill -0.22 % (pp2048),
  +0.27 % (8192), -1.06 % (20480), -2.36 % (40960) on the 4B and -0.76 %
  (20480) on the 27B, decode within 0.1 % -- hence opt-in through V4's
  switch (maintainer's instruction for the item).

- **RDNA3_5 / gfx1151 validation (2026-09-10, single Strix Halo, ROCm
  7.14, amendment to the beta block-15 patch, beta patch tip `377f8e790`)**: the block-14
  masked-V fixes and V3/V4/V5 are effective on the iGPU.  Two V3
  regressions were found and fixed: the derived-mask probe rejected
  `GGML_BACKEND_DEVICE_TYPE_IGPU` (so V3 was silently off and its
  ~800 MiB win lost), and `n_seq_max > 1` aborted context creation in
  `ggml_flash_attn_ext_add_kq_derived` (derived stream count vs
  `k->ne[3]`).  After the amendment V3 enables and the reserves reproduce
  the RDNA4 numbers exactly (4B V3 −799.20 compute / −799.21 host, V5 bf16
  968.86 → 256.86, V4 q8_0 1001.13 → 257.13; 27B 488.86 / 1072.86→488.86 /
  1121.13→489.13; Flash-Next W on 3251.39/63.69, indexer 318.76).

  36/36), FLASH_ATTN_EXT 4596/4596 ROCm0 + 7859/7859 CPU, MTP identical.
  Arm cost is *lower* than RDNA4 (V5 −0.4…−0.9 %, V4 **+2.6 %** at
  pp20480, decode ±0.1 %); V3 ~−3.2 % pp20480.  Clean-apply sim strict

Known pre-existing issue (reproduces on block 14, NOT a block-15
regression): `gemma-4-E4B-it` on 3 GPUs with `-sm tensor` aborts in the
meta splitter (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp:1177`) because `n_head_kv = 2` is
fewer than the device count; it runs on 1 GPU, on 2 GPUs and on 3 GPUs
with `-sm layer`.  No other model is affected.

— GitHub was unreachable from this host): the W4 alloc release, the W3
keys-only cache and the `llm_graph_input_attn_k` null-mask guard are all
still absent upstream, so Block 15 keeps every hunk.

### Block-14 kernel-side masked-V fixes, freed-cell host zeroing removed (2026-09-10, superseded by block 15)

Block 14's freed-cell handling moved from the host-side `zero_freed` row
zeroing (2026-09-09) to **kernel-side masked-V elimination**;
`src/llama-kv-cache.{cpp,h}` are byte-identical to the upstream state
(no `zero_freed` member, no env `LLAMA_KV_ZERO_FREED`, no per-free GPU
memsets).  Block 14 instead carries the three unconditional kernel fixes
that keep masked (freed/stale) flash-attention cells at exactly +0.0:

- HIP `fattn-tile.cuh` packed-bf16 PV path: zero the per-warp V register
  copies of fully-masked (P == +0.0) rows before the bf16 dot.
- HIP `fattn-mma-f16.cuh`: zero the rows the mask tile marks blocked in
  the staged shared V tiles (masked path `ncols2 > 1 || mask_h` only;
  `V_is_K_view`/`swz_V` compile-time excluded).
- Vulkan `flash_attn_cm1.comp` (per-column liveness: dead columns keep V
  at +0.0) + `flash_attn.comp` scalar path (skip the V load for dead
  columns).

Motivation: the 2026-09-09 host zeroing was the workaround for a
gfx1151/Strix-Halo WMMA f16 `x+(-0.0)` inexactness (masked columns leaked
the sign of whatever V their cell last held); masking V in the kernels
removes the leak at the source on every device, so the host workaround
(and its multi-GPU per-cell-memset stall) is gone entirely.

Verification (Strix Halo gfx1151 box, ROCm 7.14-gfx1151 + Vulkan RADV,
host zeroing disabled):
- 16/16 identical-request determinism gates PASS on every KV type each
  backend's FA supports — ROCm f16/bf16/q8_0/q4_0 (zeroing ON==OFF
  bit-identical over 2064 cells/run), Vulkan also q4_1/q5_0/q5_1/iq4_nl.
- `test-backend-ops` FLASH_ATTN_EXT vs CPU: 4591/4591 (ROCm0),
  7822/7822 (Vulkan0).
- Depth-16384 decode tg128 within 0.05% of pre-fix; CPU same-seed greedy
  51/64 tokens identical (divergence at a near-tie only).
- Clean-apply sim at `9113cc188`: strict 14/14 `git am`, zero whitespace
  warnings, applied tree == fork tip `ff2b35f49`.

### Block-14 freed-cell KV-row-zeroing gfx1151 gate (2026-09-09, superseded 2026-09-10)

*Superseded by the 2026-09-10 kernel-side masked-V amendment above — the
host `zero_rows`/`zero_freed` mechanism no longer exists in block 14.
Kept as the historical record.*

Block 14 amended with the gfx1151-only gate for its seq_rm/seq_keep/clear
row zeroing (the strix-lineage masked-column guard for the gfx1151 WMMA
f16 `x+(-0.0)` inexactness).  `zero_rows` now no-ops unless
`llama_kv_cache::zero_freed` is set: env `LLAMA_KV_ZERO_FREED=0/1`
overrides; otherwise the constructor enables it iff any KV buffer device
description carries `gfx1151`.

- Motivation: on multi-GPU (RDNA4/RDNA3 discrete, tensor split) the
  per-layer freed-cell zeroing memsets decompose through ggml's
  meta/multi-buffer memset into ~48xN per-cell 512-byte synced memsets
  (~30-60 µs each) — a ~13k-token KV replacement stalled ~18-24 s before
  the next prefill (model-agnostic; reproduced on qwen4exp and a plain
  dense 4B on 3x R9700 gfx1201).  The gate restores pre-block-14
  behavior off gfx1151.
- Verification (gfx1201, 3x R9700, ROCm 7.14): identical A/B workload
  24.5 s -> ~6 s; zeroing-off determinism gate (16 + 8 identical greedy
  requests, per-position top-8 logprobs float64-compared) clean.
- gfx1151 (Strix Halo box): gate logs "freed-cell KV row zeroing enabled
  (gfx1151)"; 16-run control unchanged.
- Clean-apply sim at `9113cc188`: strict 14/14 `git am`, zero whitespace
  warnings, applied tree == fork tip `27485f1ca`.

### Block-01 refresh to the PR #27210 review head (2026-09-09, current)

Block 01 was cut from llama.cpp PR #27210 (author: stew675) at its
`0994374fd` state; the PR advanced through a maintainer review round and
block 01 is refreshed to the PR head `d236d41a2` (github.com/ggml-org/
llama.cpp/pull/27210 issuecomment-5582088497), delivered as one squashed
block (`git diff 9113cc188..d236d41a2`, 15 files 519+/35-).  Review-round
changes: `has_mtp()` helper + MTP-type checks refactored through it;
`accept_partial()`/`common_speculative_accept_partial()` so checkpoint-
restore replay rounds cannot feed stale accept counts to the adaptive
controller (server + speculative-simple wired); adaptive depth reset
moves ahead of the empty-prompt early return; `--spec-draft-n-min-
adaptive` rejects values < 1 + docs (speculative.md, CLI/server READMEs);
invalid-range `GGML_ABORT` -> `std::runtime_error`; draft-mtp +
draft-mtp-adaptive together rejected; delta-net conv-state comment.
Regeneration: canonical fork rebuilt at `9113cc188`, block 01 replaced
by the squashed PR-head changeset, blocks 02-14 re-based on top (clean;
02-13 touch no block-01 file, block 14's common-file hunks disjoint).
Verification (2026-09-09, local 3x R9700 gfx1201, ROCm 7.14):

- Tree checks: old-tip..new-tip delta == exactly the review changeset
  (13 files 129+/70-, == `0994374fd..d236d41a2`), every other file
  byte-identical; regenerated 0002-0013 patch bodies byte-identical to
  the previous delivery (0014: index lines / hunk offsets only); 0001
  diff body byte-identical to the PR head changeset.
- Clean-apply sim: worktree at `9113cc188`, strict 14/14 `git am`, zero
  whitespace warnings, applied tree == fork tip `0f2b7a4e1`.
- Rebuilt unit tests pass: `./bin/test-arg-parser` (option validation /
  defaults incl. the new value-0 rejection) and
  `./bin/test-speculative-adaptive`.
- Plain-decode same-seed coherence: `llama-cli -p "The capital of France
  is" -n 20 --seed 42 --temp 0` output token-IDENTICAL to the known-good
  `050ec89ce` build (only the cosmetic spinner, build hash and run-to-run
  timings differ).  The refresh touches no GPU kernels and no
  non-speculative host decode path.

### Block-14 QSA quantized-KV decode gate + derived-cache pool gate (2026-09-07, dated record — superseded by the 2026-09-08 `9113cc188` re-base)

Report: Qwen3.8-Flash-Next Q4_K_XL llama-server (ctx 70000,
`--cache-type-k/v q8_0`, spec-draft q8_0, draft-mtp) aborts at
`llama_context` init — `GGML_ASSERT(k->type == F32/BF16/F16)` at
`ggml.c:5747` in `ggml_indexer_fill`, from `build_qsa_top_k` via the
`sched_reserve` graph probes; BF16 KV unaffected.  Root cause: the
qwen4exp indexer sub-cache is created with the same `--cache-type-k`
as the main KV cache, and the fused decode `INDEXER_SCORE`/
`INDEXER_FILL` ops (constructors + kernels) read the raw cache rows in
F32/BF16/F16 only.  Fix (folded into the block-14 commit):
`build_qsa_top_k` gates the fused decode path on an unquantized
indexer key type; quantized keys (q8_0/q4_0/q4_1/iq4_nl/q5_0/q5_1 K
caches) fall back to the per-op chain (get_rows dequantizes on
gather).  The BF16/f32 fused decode path is unchanged.  Validated on
Strix Halo (gfx1151): reported q8_0 config loads + generates
(acceptance 0.81); forced-sparse q8_0 decode runs clean; full KV-type
matrix f32/f16/bf16/q8_0/q4_0/q4_1/iq4_nl/q5_0/q5_1 start + generate
with zero errors (acceptance 0.75-0.79); BF16 forced-sparse fused
fill/score unregressed (acceptance 0.82).  Set regenerated
(`scripts/make-patches.sh`, base `050dde50c`, blocks tip
`bfcc4be99`); clean-apply sim re-verified 2026-09-07: 14/14 `git am`
clean, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree byte-identical to the
fork tip.

Second half of the same amendment: the F32 block-vector pool backing
the derived decode cache was allocated for every qwen4exp context but
is only ever written/read by the fused `INDEXER_FILL` ->
`INDEXER_SCORE` path, which additionally requires float indexer keys
(the gate above) and the memory-layer derived cache engaged
(`GGML_CUDA_QSA_INDEXER_CACHE` explicitly set; otherwise
`qsa_derived_limits` emits an empty fill range each step and the pool
is dead weight, ridden by a no-op fill launch per decode step).
`llama_memory_hybrid_idx::pool_create` now skips the allocation
unless both hold (new info log `derived indexer cache pool skipped
(...)`); with no pool `get_pool()` returns nullptr and `build_qsa_top_k`
runs the fused score pooling the raw cache — same F32 arithmetic,
byte-identical output, no dead buffer (~103 MiB at the reported
70144-token ctx = 12 layers x 128 dims x 1 stream).  Validated on
Strix Halo (gfx1151): llama-log probe shows the pool allocated only
for float keys + env set; BF16 forced-sparse same-seed decode is
byte-identical with the pool absent (default) vs present + derived
engaged (`GGML_CUDA_QSA_INDEXER_CACHE=1`); q8_0 runme config + full
KV-type matrix re-run clean (zero errors, acceptance unchanged);
clean-apply sim tree-identical to the fork tip.

### Re-baseline to 050dde50c + block 14 (2026-09-07, dated record — superseded by the 2026-09-08 `9113cc188` re-base)

Upstream master moved **22 commits** past `465e49b9c` (the 2026-09-07
master tip `050dde50c`).  The `~/llama.cpp` fork was rebuilt on the new
base via `scripts/apply-all.sh` (blocks 01-13 `git am -3`: 12 auto-merged,
one manual conflict in `tests/test-backend-ops.cpp` — block 04's perf
cases vs upstream's new LEAKY_RELU perf cases; both kept) and **block 14
(qwen4exp support) was promoted from `beta/qwen4exp`** (`git apply
--3way` of the squashed fork delta `c261553a1..dd4301fb4`; one manual
conflict in `ggml-cuda/common.cuh` — upstream's gfx90c GCN-APU arch
macros kept alongside the block's exact-SKU `GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_GFX1151`
predicate).  Canonical am-commits on the new base: `90a816a68..3bebffd6b`.
Set regenerated with `scripts/make-patches.sh` (base `050dde50c`, blocks
tip `3bebffd6b`); `rdna-boosts-all.patch` refreshed (87 files).
Re-verified 2026-09-07: clean-apply sim on a fresh checkout at
`050dde50c` (**zero conflicts, zero whitespace warnings**, applied tree
byte-identical to the fork tip `3bebffd6b`), full build clean (ROCm 7.14
gfx1201, RCCL+graphs+native), test-backend-ops 6759/6759 (MUL_MAT /
MUL_MAT_ID / FLASH_ATTN_EXT), test-llama-archs 617 OK / 0 fail incl.
qwen4exp (GPU 9.21e-14 / CPU 0.00), dense + qwen4exp llama-cli same-seed
coherence (3x R9700) — numbers in the block-14 notes of
`patches/README.md`.  Same-session block-08 amendment (PR #15,
DanoPTT): the mul_mat+add through-view fusion guard folded into block
08 (delivery commit, see `patches/README.md`); clean-apply sim
re-verified, build clean, test-backend-ops 6759/6759, dense 27B Q8_0
same-seed byte-identical pre vs post fix, 3-GPU hybrid == RCCL
IDENTICAL, parallel 2-slot llama-server decode clean (dense 27B +
qwen4exp IQ4_XS).
### Re-baseline to 465e49b9c (2026-09-06)

Upstream master moved **18 commits** past the fold-verified base
`8b4b3558f` (57 past the old delivery fork point `9cffdcc80`).  The
`~/llama.cpp` fork was rebuilt from `patches/` via `scripts/apply-all.sh`
on the fresh master tip — 13/13 `git am` clean, **zero conflicts, zero
whitespace warnings**: the ggml-cuda-touching upstream commits
(`73a43d1f6` mmid/mmf race fixes #28475, `5fdfa6282` GDN l2-norm fix
#28068 — model-layer only) landed in disjoint hunks; no manual merges
needed.  Per-file content check on all 112 upstream-touched files:
deltas == old-fork + upstream drift exactly; the 14 extra differing
files are the 2026-09-06 Strix fold delta.  Set regenerated
(`scripts/make-patches.sh`, base `465e49b9c`, blocks tip `c261553a1`,
am-commits `45bf4d291..c261553a1`) + `rdna-boosts-all.patch` refreshed
(45 files; was stale at 41).  Prerequisites: restored the format-patch
mail headers the 0044cfe fold had stripped from 0002/0004/0008/0013
(commit 0610b75), and re-dated the block-13 message's fold-amendment
trailer to the fold's true date (block-13 tip amended `b4b760eb8` ->
`c261553a1`).  Clean-apply sim at `465e49b9c` re-verified 2026-09-06
(zero conflicts/whitespace warnings; applied tree byte-identical to the
fork tip).  The `qwen4exp` fork branch was rebuilt on the new base
(`465e49b9c` + blocks + the consolidated beta support patch — see
`beta/qwen4exp/README.md`).

### Re-baseline to 9cffdcc80 (2026-09-02)

Upstream master moved **42 commits** past the fork point `0eadefebd`; 3
touching ggml-cuda — `3d3d7c818` (unused-var removals, #28235),
`8e93a9773` (sparse-fa for DSV4/GLM, #27970: a 4th `use_sparse` bool on
`launch_fattn`, fattn-tile/fattn-common edits) and `3466812d1` (fused MoE
weighted-expert reduction, #25952: a new arm in `ggml_cuda_try_fuse`) —
plus common/server arg churn (`e750b887a`). The fork's `rdna-boosts`
branch was rebuilt from the delivery patches on the new base
(`~/llama.cpp`, blocks `04122bfb5..92f09e80a`; plain `git am`, with the
failed hunks resolved by hand per the BASELINE drift policy — no
fork-blob 3-way crutches, matching what a fresh puller experiences) and
the set regenerated with `scripts/make-patches.sh` (base `9cffdcc80`,
blocks tip `92f09e80a`). Three blocks needed manual re-base hunks:

1. **Block 03 vs #27970:** 6 fattn-tile.cuh call sites + the
   `launch_fattn_tile_switch_ncols2` template line (type_KV threading);
   merged as `need_f16_K, need_f16_V, false, false, warp_size` on each
   `launch_fattn` call (upstream's `stream_k`/`use_sparse` stay false).
2. **Block 08 vs #25952:** the rms_norm->mmvq quantize-fold arm now sits
   after upstream's `GGML_OP_MUL` MoE-reduction arm in
   `ggml_cuda_try_fuse`.  Also folded into the block-08 commit: the
   block-08 spec-verify `launch_fattn` call site in fattn-tile.cuh still
   passed the pre-#27970 3-bool arg list — the `warp_size` int bound
   into the new `use_sparse` bool slot (compiles; `use_sparse=true`;
   runtime `GGML_ASSERT(n_kv_max > 0)` in fattn-common.cuh).  Fixed to
   the 4-bool form; caught by the coherence gate (crash), not the build.
3. **Block 13 vs #25952:** `disable_moe_mmq` opt-out static + `const int
   cc` decls at the top of `ggml_cuda_try_fuse` restored after
   upstream's inserted arm.

Regenerating from the new base folds upstream's changes into the patch
context, so **`scripts/apply-all.sh` applies all 13 blocks with plain
`git am` — zero conflicts, zero whitespace warnings** on a fresh checkout
at `9cffdcc80`. Re-verified end-to-end 2026-09-02: clean-apply sim
(fresh worktree at `9cffdcc80`, applied tree byte-identical to the fork
tip `92f09e80a`), full build clean (ROCm 7.14 gfx1201, RCCL+graphs+
native, zero errors; build note: `EXTRA_CMAKE_FLAGS="-DCMAKE_HIP_FLAGS="`
is required with CMake >= 4.3 — the build script's bare `-mllvm`
swallows the HIP-test-injected `--cuda-host-only`), llama-cli same-seed
coherence **IDENTICAL between hybrid and RCCL** (3-GPU tensor split,
Qwen3.5-4B Q8_0). Numbers unchanged (content-identical plus upstream's
additions).

### Block-13 MTP regression fixes (2026-09-02, current)

Block 13 (the fork's block-13 commit, amended in place) now carries two
regression fixes found by the adaptive-MTP investigation of 2026-09-02:

1. **Dense MTP/verify decode collapse** (`mmvq.cu`): the block-13 mmvq
   item-split kernel + RDNA rows_per_block override is register-bound at
   multi-token decode batches (ncols 2..8 = the speculative verify step;
   `tmp[ncols_dst][rpb]` fan-out).  Fix: re-add the pre-block-13 K-split
   kernel as `mul_mat_vec_q_ksplit` and dispatch ncols 2..8 + long-K
   (K >= 4096) ncols==1 rows to it.  Dense qwen35 27B Q4_K_XL adaptive-MTP
   18.3 -> 27.5 t/s (output bit-identical to the 12-block build); plain
   decode 29.0 -> 30.1 (+3.1-3.7% at d0/d16384/d65536).
2. **MoE MTP verify-numerics collapse** (`ggml-cuda.cu` try_fuse arm): the
   block-08 rms_norm->mmvq Q8_1 quantize-cache fold corrupts multi-token
   MUL_MAT_ID (the moe kernel consumes the cached Q8_1 y wrongly), so MoE
   verify-batch logits diverge from single-token decode and MTP draft
   acceptance collapses to 0/1527 (draft-mtp 53 vs plain 90 t/s on
   qwen35moe-A3B Q4_K_M-UD; upstream accelerates +51%).  Fix: gate the
   fold to single-token MMID (ne[2]==1) and plain MUL_MAT consumers.
   MoE acceptance restored to 0.51 (== fully-unfused 0.49 == upstream
   0.49), draft-mtp 119-129 t/s vs upstream ~110-113; MoE plain decode
   and the single-token fusion gains unchanged; dense unaffected.

Re-verified end-to-end 2026-09-02 after the amendment: set regenerated
from the fork (`scripts/make-patches.sh`, base `9cffdcc80`, blocks tip
`8f2838d1`), clean-apply sim at `9cffdcc80` (git am clean, zero
whitespace warnings, applied tree byte-identical to the fork tip),
build clean, dense same-seed coherence identical, MoE MTP sanity on the
sim build (acceptance 0.54, 128 t/s).  The adaptive-MTP baseline gate +
numbers now live in `benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md` (the
decode-only suites cannot see MTP regressions — verify batches ncols 2..13
and the draft context are never exercised there).

### Runtime NCCL-failure fallback (2026-09-04, issue #13, current)

Community issue #13 (reporter tungel — same reporter as the #5/#6 fix
round): on a topology where RCCL >= 2.30.4 cannot dispatch its kernels,
`ncclCommInitAll` succeeds but the first collective aborts
(`hipErrorIllegalState` when a GPU sits behind a PCIe root port without
32/64-bit AtomicOp completer support — e.g. PCH/Z390; see
ROCm/ROCm#6520), and the process died at the first prefill AllReduce
(`NCCL_CHECK` -> `GGML_ABORT`) even though the internal host-staged
pipeline was up and stable.  Folded into the block-12 commit: on the
first NCCL runtime failure the comm layer clears the sticky HIP errors
on each AR device (else the fallback aborts on the next CUDA_CHECK),
warns once with a pointer at the known cause + the
`dmesg | grep -i atomic` check, permanently stops using NCCL (comm
state is unknown), re-routes subsequent AllReduce to the internal
pipeline (or the meta backend's butterfly when no pipeline is
available), and the failing call itself returns false so the butterfly
handles it; `ncclCommDestroy` at teardown is non-fatal too.  No behavior
change on healthy setups — the fallback only triggers when NCCL itself
fails.

Re-verified end-to-end 2026-09-04: set regenerated from the fork
(`scripts/make-patches.sh`, base `9cffdcc80`, blocks tip `b830050bf`),
clean-apply sim at `9cffdcc80` (git am clean, zero whitespace warnings,
applied tree byte-identical to the fork tip), full build clean (ROCm
7.14 gfx1201, RCCL+graphs+native), llama-cli same-seed coherence
IDENTICAL pre vs post fix (27B Q8_0, 3-GPU tensor split), and perf
unregressed at depth-16384 hybrid: 2-GPU (1,2) tg128 32.48 -> 32.40,
3-GPU (0,1,2) tg128 39.33 -> 39.31 (both within noise; pp512 within
run-to-run spread).

### Strix Halo (RDNA3_5, gfx1151) fused-MoE-MMQ validation (2026-09-05, current)

Block 13's fused MoE gate+up+GLU MMQ prefill arm (`ggml-cuda.cu`
try_fuse) and its `J_max_gate` tile-width caps (`mmq.cuh`) were
RDNA4-only — "disabled until validated on other arches".  Validated on
Strix Halo (Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 / Radeon 8060S, ROCm 7.14, gfx1151, 16C /
123 GB) with Qwen3.6-35B-A3B True-Q3_K_M (Q3_K is in the fused type
list), `-ub 2048 -t 16`, llama-bench `-r 8`:

- gate relaxed to RDNA4 + RDNA3_5, RDNA4-tuned caps applied on both;
  fusion confirmed firing (one-time log during the session);
- same-seed coherence IDENTICAL fused-on vs off (20 tok, seed 42);
- prefill gains match RDNA4: pp2048 1590.7 -> 1674-1676 (+5.3%),
  pp16384 1360-1361 -> 1423-1425 (+4.6%), pp512 ~948 -> ~1094 (+14%,
  noisy single-ubatch row); decode unchanged (tg128 71.5);
- caps transfer: uncapping J (128) on gfx1151 regressed pp2048 1674 ->
  1111 (±166, unstable) and pp16384 1423 -> 1334 (register pressure),
  i.e. no per-arch port tuning needed for the fused MMQ;
- methodology notes: on this APU the first llama-bench test after
  process start runs at a cold GPU clock (pp2048 read 1275±166 when
  first) — a short pp512 warmup test first restores stability
  (1674±3).

RDNA3_0 (gfx1100, 7900XTX-class) is still excluded from the fused arm
until validated there (hardware is the community-member parallel task).

The set was regenerated 2026-09-05 from a canonical fork rebuilt at
`9cffdcc80` (`scripts/make-patches.sh`, base `9cffdcc80`, blocks tip
`ace0a5d54`), and the clean-apply sim was re-verified end-to-end on the
Strix machine itself: git am clean, zero whitespace warnings, applied
tree byte-identical to the canonical fork tip, full build clean (ROCm
7.14 gfx1151, RCCL+graphs+native, `-mllvm --amdgpu-unroll-threshold-
local=600`), sim same-seed coherence identical, sim pp2048 1676.3 /
pp16384 1424.6 (fused) vs 1590.7 / 1361.4 (unfused) — the regenerated
set reproduces the validated gains.  `rdna-boosts-all.patch`
regenerated (applies cleanly at `9cffdcc80`).  Full session record:
`archive/work/wip-archive/qwen4exp/discovery/2026-09-05-strix-halo-gfx1151-block-13-moe-mmq.md`.

### RX 7900 XTX (RDNA3_0, gfx1100) fused-MoE-MMQ validation (2026-09-05, current)

Block 13's fused MoE gate+up+GLU MMQ prefill arm (`ggml-cuda.cu`
try_fuse) and its `J_max_gate` tile-width caps (`mmq.cuh`) covered
RDNA4 + RDNA3_5; RDNA3_0 (gfx1100) was the last excluded arch.
Validated on a single RX 7900 XTX (AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, ROCm 7.14,
gfx1100; `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` to exclude the box's HIP-visible
gfx1036 iGPU) with Qwen3.6-35B-A3B True-Q3_K_M (Q3_K is in the fused
type list), `-ub 2048 -t 16`, llama-bench `-r 8`:

- gate relaxed to RDNA4 + RDNA3_5 + RDNA3_0, RDNA4-tuned caps applied
  on all three; fusion confirmed firing on gfx1100 (one-time session
  log, removed before landing);
- same-seed coherence IDENTICAL fused-on vs off (20 tok, seed 42), and
  the ungated build's 3-op fallback output is byte-identical to the
  pre-ungate baseline binary (fallback unperturbed by the ungate);
- prefill gains exceed the Strix/RDNA4 band on this card: pp2048
  4938.7 -> 5405.0 (+9.4%), pp16384 4161.7 -> 4487.2 (+7.8%), pp512
  ~+20% (noisy single-ubatch row); decode unchanged (tg128 130.3 vs
  130.4);
- caps transfer: uncapping J (128) on gfx1100 regressed pp2048 5405 ->
  4819 and pp16384 4487 -> 4070 — below the 3-op fallback (register
  pressure); a Q3_K@96 probe (5094/4251) also lost to the cap 64, i.e.
  no per-arch port tuning needed for the fused MMQ;
- block 12 stays N/A on this single-GPU box (no all-reduce path); the
  dual-7900XTX block-12 leg remains a separately-tracked parallel task
  (no allreduce code touched).

The set was regenerated 2026-09-05 from a canonical fork rebuilt at
`9cffdcc80` (`scripts/make-patches.sh`, base `9cffdcc80`, blocks tip
`8c2ace510`; patches 0001-0012 changed only in patch headers — the new
canonical-rebuild commit hashes; bodies byte-identical), and the
clean-apply sim was re-verified end-to-end on the 7900 XTX box: git am
clean at `9cffdcc80`, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree
byte-identical to the canonical fork tip, full build clean (ROCm 7.14
gfx1100, RCCL+graphs+native), sim same-seed coherence identical, sim
pp2048 5394.2 / pp16384 4481.6 (fused) vs 4938.7 / 4161.7 (3-op) — the
regenerated set reproduces the validated gains.  `rdna-boosts-all.patch`
regenerated (applies cleanly at `9cffdcc80`).  Full session record:
`archive/work/wip-archive/qwen4exp/discovery/2026-09-05-rdna3-gfx1100-block-13-moe-mmq.md`.

### Re-baseline to 0eadefebd (2026-09-01)

Fork point moved from `a7cc83bba` to upstream master `0eadefebd` (22
commits of drift; 3 touching ggml-cuda — XOR-swizzle fattn #25635, radix
TOP_K #27466, MOE-fusion #27621). The fork's `rdna-boosts` branch was
rebuilt from the delivery patches on the new base (worktree at
`0eadefebd`; blocks 01-07 + 09-12 applied cleanly, block 08 via
`git am -3` auto-3way; the tree is byte-identical to the verified
2026-09-01 cross-version apply below) and the set regenerated with
`scripts/make-patches.sh` (base `0eadefebd`, blocks tip `d7bdd0a91`,
block 12 committed as `ce9182473`; the old `a7cc83bba`-based fork state
is preserved on the `rdna-boosts-a7cc83bba` branch). Regenerating from
the new base folds upstream's changes into the patch context, so
**`scripts/apply-all.sh` now applies all 12 blocks with plain `git am` —
zero conflicts, zero whitespace warnings** on a fresh checkout at
`0eadefebd` (the 2026-09-01 apply below needed `git am -3` for block 08
only because the set then still carried the old base's context). Verified
end-to-end 2026-09-01: clean-apply sim on a fresh clone at `0eadefebd`
(sim tree byte-identical to the fork tip `ce9182473`), full build clean,
llama-cli same-seed coherence IDENTICAL to the pre-re-base known-good
build, tg64 38.12 / tg512 41.08 unchanged (code-identical content;
re-measured 2026-09-01: sim 36.87±4.83 / 40.72±1.02, prs 37.92±4.67 /
40.90±0.86 — within noise).

### AR_PROFILE devices[] init fix + fork re-sync (2026-09-01)

- **Fix (PR #8, integrated into block 12 + the fork):** in
  `allreduce-hip.cu`, `p->devices[]` is now filled from the caller list
  BEFORE the per-device profiler hipMallocs.  Under
  `GGML_CUDA_AR_PROFILE=1` the buffers were previously allocated while
  `devices[]` was still zero-filled, so every buffer landed on GPU 0 and
  MTP's second pipeline init (draft context) faulted/hung GPU 1
  (gfx1201).  A/B on 3x R9700 (2-GPU, internal AR, MTP n-max 3,
  `-c 32768`, AR_PROFILE=1): pre-fix reproduced — GPU-1 memory fault in
  `ggml_cuda_ar_kernel` (exit 134); post-fix runs clean with teardown
  profiler dumps on dev0 AND dev1 in both pipelines; llama-cli same-seed
  coherence IDENTICAL to the pre-fix golden (default serving, profiler
  off, is byte-for-byte unchanged).
- **Fork re-sync:** the fork's `rdna-boosts` was rebuilt as a clean
  12-commit branch directly on `0eadefebd` (block 01 `b25bc8a9c` .. block
  11 `43f5ab71d`, block 12 `93e8b09bb`).  The previous fork rebuild had
  picked up upstream master's `kleidiai` docs commit `518b76236` as a
  13th base commit; that upstream commit is NOT part of the block set
  (it remains in upstream `origin/master`) and was dropped from the
  branch.
- **Set regenerated:** `scripts/make-patches.sh` (base `0eadefebd`,
  blocks tip `43f5ab71d`) re-exported blocks 01-11 (content-identical to
  the previous delivery — only the `From <sha>` headers moved) + the
  block-12 delta (with the AR_PROFILE fix); `rdna-boosts-all.patch`
  regenerated as `git diff 0eadefebd..93e8b09bb`.
- **Re-verified 2026-09-01:** clean-apply sim on a fresh clone at
  `0eadefebd` — `scripts/apply-all.sh` applied all 12 blocks with ZERO
  whitespace warnings and the applied tree is byte-identical to the fork
  tip (`d42fc80…`); the fork tree was fully built (ROCm 7.14 gfx1201,
  clean) and coherence-tested as part of the A/B above.

### MTP chunked-GDN prefix folded into block 02 (2026-09-01, PR #9)

- **Change (PR #9, integrated into block 02 — NOT a new block):** block
  02's chunked WMMA GDN only launched for `K == 1` (no MTP snapshots);
  with MTP n-max 3 (`K=4`) every prefill ubatch stayed on the sequential
  kernel (rocprof ~4k wrap: sequential GDN at 10.45%).  The dispatch now
  runs, for long single-sequence prefills (`!kda && K > 1 && n_seqs == 1
  && n_tokens > K+64`), the chunked GDN on the prefix (`n_tokens - K`)
  and sequential GDN only on the last K tokens so slots `0..K-1` stay
  correct (fused-cache graphs included; `n_seqs > 1` stays fully
  sequential).  The chunked ops gained an `n_tokens_limit` parameter
  (`gated_delta_net_chunked{.cu,.cuh,_bf16.cu,_bf16_gfx11.cu}`).
  Opt out: `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0`.  Because the change is confined to
  block-02 files, it was folded into the block-02 commit (fixup +
  autosquash; blocks 03-12 replayed cleanly, tree unchanged).
- **Verified 2026-09-01 (3x R9700 gfx1201, ROCm 7.14, 2-GPU 0,1,
  internal AR, Qwen3.8-27B Q8, ubatch 1024, MTP n-max 3):** path fire
  confirmed (`MTP chunked GDN prefix n=1024 K=4 prefix=1020`); prefill
  tok/s: ~5.5k prompt 1406.5 -> 1511.4 (+7.5%), ~38k 1303.0 -> 1403.1
  (+7.7%); 64-token same-seed output token-IDENTICAL vs sequential (only
  the timing line differed).  Non-MTP serving unchanged (coherence
  IDENTICAL to the pre-change golden).  Full clean build passes.  PR's
  lab numbers (up to +8.1% at 40k, GSM8K 19/50 vs 18/50):
  `benchmarks/2026-08-31-mtp-gdn-chunked-prefix.md`.
- **Set regenerated:** blocks 01, 03-11 content-identical (only `From
  <sha>` headers moved); block 02 = old block 02 + the PR #9 hunks;
  `rdna-boosts-all.patch` regenerated.  Clean-apply sim re-verified on a
  fresh clone at `0eadefebd` (zero whitespace warnings, applied tree
  byte-identical to the fork tip `b90eb525e`).

### Re-baseline to a7cc83bba (2026-08-30, superseded)

Fork point moved from `17252c769` to upstream master `a7cc83bba` (24
commits of drift; 6 touching ggml-cuda). The fork's `rdna-boosts` branch
was rebuilt from the delivery patches on the new base and the set
regenerated with `scripts/make-patches.sh` (base `a7cc83bba`, blocks tip
`8fbf10e5b`, block 12 committed as `4fa92f0ae`). Blocks 01-07 and 09-12
applied cleanly; the ONE conflict was block 08 vs upstream's SWIGLU_CLAMP
(#27930, landed 2026-08-30): its `glu_limit` additions to the mm-fusion
args structs (`common.cuh`) and `mmvq.cu` (decls, fusion-assign, the
GLU-switch/result-write restructure, `fusion_local`) were merged alongside
block 08's `dst_gate`/`conv_*`/`x_scale_channel_dst` work (verified: the
merged files diff vs block-08's post-image blobs = exactly upstream's
additions, nothing else). Verified end-to-end 2026-08-30: clean-apply sim
on a fresh clone at `a7cc83bba` (zero conflicts, zero whitespace
warnings), full build clean, llama-cli same-seed coherence IDENTICAL to
the pre-re-base known-good build.

### Cross-version apply at 0eadefebd (2026-09-01, record)

Upstream master moved 22 commits past the fork point; 3 touched
ggml-cuda (XOR-swizzle fattn #25635, radix TOP_K #27466, MOE-fusion
#27621). The 12-patch set was applied to a fresh clone at `0eadefebd`
(branch `rdna-boosts`): blocks 01-07 + 09-12 clean (`git am` / `git
apply`); the ONE conflict was block 08, resolved by `git am -3` 3-way
merge (auto-resolved, zero manual hunks). Full-tree zero-drift check:
`fork-tip → HEAD` = exactly the 51-file upstream delta, all diffs
content-identical vs the fork delivery tip `4fa92f0ae`. Build clean
(ROCm 7.14 gfx1201) and same-seed coherence hybrid == RCCL (3-GPU).
Fork point unchanged at `a7cc83bba` per the drift policy (regeneration
triggered only when >1 block needs manual re-base hunks; here: one
block, auto-3way). The verified applied state is tagged
`rdna-boosts-0eadefebd` in the ~/prs/llama.cpp clone. Full record:
`BASELINE.md`.

### Baseline 17252c769 (2026-08-29, superseded)

On a fresh checkout of the fork point `17252c769`:

```
git am patches/000[1-9]-*.patch patches/001[0-3]-*.patch   # blocks 01-13
#      (or: scripts/apply-all.sh — same thing, one commit each)
```

Verified end-to-end 2026-08-29: clean apply, full build, llama-cli
same-seed coherence IDENTICAL to the fork build, tg64 38.12 / tg512 41.08
(matches the fork build). Re-verified 2026-09-01 with block 13 on the
13-patch series: clean apply, applied tree byte-identical to the fork tip.
**Do not `git apply` the concatenated 01-13 series directly — it silently
drops hunks** (30 files / 2483 lines vs the correct 35 / 6094 for the old
12-set; the same caveat applies). The historical validation records below
(14883/14883, GDN 46/46, etc.) are from the older 01-11 structure and
remain the
verification evidence for the block content, which is byte-unchanged.

### Whitespace-clean regeneration (2026-08-29, follow-up)

The previous patch files carried trailing-whitespace lines (8
pure-whitespace blank lines in block 02's two bf16 GDN files + one
blank-at-EOF line in block 12's `allreduce.cuh`), which made `git am` /
`git apply` print whitespace warnings on every apply. Fixed at the source:
the fork's `rdna-boosts` block commits were rebuilt in place (each
commit's diff re-applied with `git apply --whitespace=fix`) and the whole
12-patch set re-generated with `scripts/make-patches.sh` (block-12 tip
`cc985ba9a`, block 12 now committed as `12d10267b`).

Re-verified end-to-end 2026-08-29: `scripts/apply-all.sh` on a fresh
checkout at `17252c769` runs with **ZERO whitespace warnings**; the
applied tree is byte-identical to the previous applied tree except the 8
whitespace lines and 1 EOF blank line (all inert — pure-whitespace blank
lines, no string-literal or continuation content). No behavioral change:
the validation records above still describe this set.

### Block-12 compiler-warning cleanup (2026-08-29, follow-up)

The HIP port's `allreduce-hip.cu` was the HIP build's ONLY source of
compiler warnings.  ROCm 7.14 marks the entire `hipError_t` enum
`[[nodiscard]]`, so every unchecked HIP call emitted `-Wunused-value`
(27 sites / 54 warning lines in the ggml-hip build — every other file in
the tree checks or `(void)`-casts each hip call).  Fixed at the source in
the fork: all 27 sites wrapped in `CUDA_CHECK(...)` (upstream house
style, including teardown frees/destroys, which the CUDA original leaves
unchecked but HIP's nodiscard enum flags), plus three dead WIP items
removed (unused `stage_marker` kernel parameter, unused `wire_bf16` local
in the stage hook, uncalled `ggml_cuda_ar_arrival_ptr` helper).  The
block-12 commit was amended in the fork (tip now `43e6ced06`) and the
12-patch set re-generated with `scripts/make-patches.sh`.

Re-verified 2026-08-29: full HIP build (ROCm 7.14, gfx1201) emits ZERO
compiler warnings from the patch (the only remaining build warning is the
build script's `-mllvm` link-time artifact — pre-existing, unrelated);
`scripts/apply-all.sh` on a fresh checkout at `17252c769` applies with
zero whitespace warnings and the applied tree is byte-identical to the
fork tip; llama-cli same-seed coherence still IDENTICAL to RCCL (3-GPU);
the `GGML_CUDA_AR_PROFILE=1` teardown path (where most of the new
CUDA_CHECKs live) runs clean.


### Community-report fix round (2026-08-30, issues #5 + #6)

External report (tungel, 2x gfx1201) surfaced two block-12 bugs, fixed at
source in the fork (`~/llama.cpp` rdna-boosts, tip `8a426cf79`) and the
12-patch set regenerated with `scripts/make-patches.sh`:

- **RCCL-less build failure (#5):** `comm_init_hybrid` referenced
  `ggml_backend_cuda_comm_try_allreduce_nccl` (defined only under
  `GGML_USE_NCCL`) unconditionally — `-DGGML_HIP_RCCL=OFF` builds failed
  to compile.  The reference is now guarded; the no-NCCL flavor keeps the
  internal-pipeline behavior (verified: RCCL=OFF `ggml-hip` builds).
- **Unbounded in-kernel spin (#6):** the chunked AR kernel spun on peer
  arrival with no exit condition; on RDNA (non-preemptible compute
  kernels) a lost arrival wedges the queue -> MES `REMOVE_QUEUE` timeout
  -> MODE1 reset -> `700/719` or whole-machine freeze.  The spin is now
  bounded (`GGML_CUDA_AR_SPIN_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 20 ms, `0` = legacy);
  on timeout the kernel sets a host-mapped poison flag, skips the reduce
  and exits, and the host re-syncs the devices with a butterfly AllReduce
  on the next call.

Re-verified 2026-08-30: clean-apply sim at `17252c769` (apply, full
build, llama-cli same-seed coherence IDENTICAL); RCCL=OFF `ggml-hip`
compiles; before/after perf (default hybrid, 2x R9700, depth-16384):
pp512 1622.7 -> 1609.1 t/s and tg128 32.63 -> 32.55 t/s — both within
run-to-run noise, no measurable impact from the bounded-spin fix.

> current fork's commit hashes (e.g. block 01 = `142ab7846`); the earlier

Convenience: `rdna-boosts-all.patch` (repo root) is the entire 16-patch net
as ONE patch (applies cleanly on `9113cc188` alone; not a substitute for the
per-block flow in `patches/` when you want reviewable increments).

**Release gates (all mandatory).** `scripts/validate-set.sh` covers only the patch/apply integrity and
runs in CI. The model-level gates are manual and must be recorded in the release's `WORKLOG.md` entry:
(1) the same-seed **coherence gate** (above), (2) the **MTP gate**
(`benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md`), and (3) the **prefill-logit KLD gate**
(`scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh`, protocol in `benchmarks/prefill-logit-methodology.md`; mean KLD <=
0.005 and same-top-p >= 98 % against a recorded known-good base; required for any change to a prefill
kernel or a default-on approximate path).


## Failure handling (agent instruction)

> Apply the patches in `patches/` in the order given in this file to a fresh
> branch from the fork point `0eadefebd` (see `scripts/apply-all.sh` for the

> against the current master and continue. Do not skip blocks. The fused
> core (`0008-...`) is applied at position 8; blocks 09-11 go after it, then
> blocks 12-13 (hybrid AR, fused MoE). If more than one
> block needs manual re-base hunks, regenerate the whole set from the fork

## Known notes (working)
- **iq1_m MUL_MAT_ID flake — FIXED in block 08** (Q8_1 input cache keyed by `src1->data`); full story: `archive/docs/validation-history.md`
- **MTP draft + `--split-mode tensor` graph-alloc crash — FIXED by block 09** (meta headroom 16x -> 128x); full story: `archive/docs/validation-history.md`
- **Block 02 carries the test-harness seeding fix** (restores `random_device` seeding; the fork's deterministic seed exposed `rms_norm_back`/`cross_entropy_loss_back` fragility on RDNA4). GDN kernels untouched. See `archive/docs/baseline-history.md` for the diagnostic.
- **Block 08 test hunk** was re-based against the original baseline: its
  original context lines (Q6_K perf cases) were added by block 04. On this
  branch the hunk applies with the re-based placement; content is identical
  to the fork, only position differs.
- **Block 10 test hunks** anchor on the Q6_K/Q8_0 decode-shape rows and the
  `qwen3-30b-a3b` loops (folded in from retired block 09). Applied in
  manifest order they sit on the re-based block-09 hunk; do not re-order
  the test hunks when re-basing.
- **`test-backend-ops.cpp` is shared** by blocks 02/03/04/08/10. The hunks
  are in different case regions; if upstream adds cases in those regions,
  re-base the affected hunks (each patch applies independently on the
  baseline, so re-basing is local to the failing file).
- **Block 08 is genuinely inseparable**: its 16 commits co-developed the
  fused mmvq kernel region, the `ggml-cuda.cu` try_fuse machinery, and the
  `fattn.cu` dispatch cluster. It is extracted as ONE combined diff on
  purpose. Do not try to split it.
- **Block 08 vs upstream SWIGLU_CLAMP (2026-08-30 re-base):** upstream's
  #27930 added `glu_limit` to the same mm-fusion regions block 08 rewrites
  (`common.cuh` args structs; `mmvq.cu` decls / fusion-assign /
  GLU-switch restructure / `fusion_local`). The re-base merged them side
  by side; the SWIGLU_CLAMP case now lives inside block 08's restructured
  switch on `result_val`. If a future re-base hits this again: keep
  upstream's `glu_limit` lines, re-apply block 08's additions around
  them, and verify with the post-image-blob diff (merged file minus
  block-08 blob must equal exactly upstream's additions).
- **Blocks 06 and 09 (old numbering) were retired**: their content folded into block 10 (the k-quant umbrella); numbering compacted to 01-10, then 01-11, then +12. Full history: `archive/docs/baseline-history.md`.
- When upstream master moves past the fork point and more than one block needs manual re-base hunks, regenerate from the fork with `scripts/make-patches.sh` (see `BASELINE.md` drift policy).

## History
All dated validation records, the retired block-structure churn, and the old block-11 perf profile now live in `archive/docs/validation-history.md` and `archive/docs/baseline-history.md`.
