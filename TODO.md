# rdna-boosts TODO / follow-up tracker

Cross-project tracker so important state survives context compaction.  **Forward-looking only**: this
file lists what is still open (active work, waiting items, accepted limitations, parked ideas);
closed and retired work lives in `WORKLOG.md` and the dated records it points to.  Details never
live here — they live in `AGENTS.md`, `patches/README.md`, `MANIFESTS.md`, `WORKLOG.md`,
`GREEDY-PURITY.md`, `wip/*` and `benchmarks/`.

**Current state (release `v16-a55e952b8-r32`, 2026-10-08):** the delivery is the **16-patch set** against
fork point **`a55e952b8`**, canonical tip `6a443a1b50f29e321ecae05997faa046b88705ab`, net tree
**`8798d38b8e2c649d5aacba3a84d1dd108fe31526`** (`validate-set.sh` green; `apply-all.sh` on a fresh clone
reproduces the tree).  `release.json` is the source of truth.  r32 fixes the two bugs found during the
PR #115 review: **#48** the post-prefill re-reserve now uses the current ubatch's sequence count so a
multi-sequence decode does not build a zero-token attention graph (block 06), and **#49** the meta
split-state computation is pre-warmed bottom-up so a >1200-node `src` chain no longer overflows the
stack (block 15); both `TODO` items are closed.  Before it, r31 folded PR #115 into block 06 (the MoE
expert-cache decode/verify band follows the routed-expert MMVQ band, 16 tokens on RDNA4, 8 on
RDNA3/NVIDIA, via a single-owner `moe_cache_band` hook and a device-side admission fill-list fix;
`GGML_MOE_CACHE_MAX_TOK=8` restores the old band).  Before that, r30 root-caused issue #113: the r29 bf16
divergence was an `A_sc` stride aliasing bug for `n_seqs > 1`, so `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED_BF16` is
default-on again (near-lossless).  Before it, r29 flipped it off as a workaround; r28 folded the
`--host-experts` flag into block 06, r27 PR #114's four bit-identical
qwen4exp decode fusions into block 15 (default-on `=0` kill-switches).  Before it, r26 folded PR #107's
DFlash F1 default-on and PR #110's DPP butterflies, and r25 folded eight of the nine PR #106 (issue #105)
patches into blocks 06/08/14/15 plus `TODO #45` (patch 0002, the data-pointer graph key, is dropped, see
#46).  The release-by-release record (r24's cache-floor fix + repack, r22's movable-boundary slab,
movable-boundary slab, r21's `llama-cli` drop, r20's compute-buffer slack, r19/r18/r17, ...) is in
`WORKLOG.md` and the campaign records under `archive/work/`; the closed tracker items (#37/#40/#41/#43,
#42, and this session's #44/#39/#38) are in `WORKLOG.md` as well.  See `AGENTS.md` for the policy layer.

## Active (kept compact: only what this repo will work on next)

### 50. The cache-aware fusion guard is global while the slab's eviction is per-table (code `OPEN 2`)

**RESOLVED (2026-10-10), DELIVERED in `v16-a55e952b8-r40`.**  The guard is now **per-table**
(`moe_cache_table_serves`, mirroring the take-over's `identity` decision) and the **device-remap path that
could disagree with it has been deleted from the code base** (block 06 no longer creates it).  The eager
host-routing path is the only `-sm tensor` split policy: MTP-pure on qwen4exp (`none == n3`),
budget-sweep-pure (MIB8000 vs MIB14000 `None`), and within run-to-run noise of the old `DEVMAP=0`
performance (delivery MTP prefill 1585.2 vs 1587.0, decode 72.36 vs 72.56; plain prefill 1471.8 vs 1471.9,
decode 41.73 vs 41.80).  See `wip/moe-verify-fusions/FINDINGS-devmap-removal.md`.

**Working home: `wip/moe-verify-fusions/`** (tracked together with #51 — the maintainer suspects a shared root cause on the cache-band routed-MMVQ verify path).

**Opened 2026-10-10 (WIP finding, `archive/work/slab-ring-region/`).**  `ggml_cuda_cache_blocks_fusion`
(`ggml-cuda.cu:5804`) is gated on the **global** `moe_cache_has_arena()`, but the movable-boundary slab
evicts cache tables **per table** — `moe-expert-cache.cu` says *"the movable-boundary slab evicts the
tables in the chunks it hands to the work pool, so a PARTIAL cache is the normal state"*.  Any arena
change therefore flips the cache-aware fusions for the whole model *mid-run*: the H2D-ring region (item
49), the G4 refusal, `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_RESERVE_MIB`, a `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_RESERVE_MIB` change.  The fused and
non-fused paths are not bit-identical (the code says the stand-down "changes the arithmetic"), so the
greedy output then depends on the **timing** of the eviction.  The code already carries the marker:
*"OPEN 2: the wholesale-fallback invariant … must hold for EVERY consumer, not just the fusion guard and
the take-over hook."*

Evidence + the A/B matrix: `archive/work/slab-ring-region/FINDINGS-numerics.md` F3.  On the field model
(ring-in-slab vs ring-outside) the placements differ; with **every** individual fusion switch off but the
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_FUSION`-gated alloc-deps pass still ON they agree, which also **excludes PR #27301's
alloc dependencies** as the cause (the deps do cost +512 MiB of compute buffer, charged to the arena).  Not
one bad kernel either — either the qwen4exp HC group or the idx/concat/DSV4 group alone removes it, so it
is a cumulative rounding shift.  No corruption: 0 NaN, 0 `////`, prefill logits bit-identical; the visible
symptom is one flipped near-tie at the first novel decode token.

**Fix direction:** make the guard per-table (as the marker asks) so a partial cache keeps serving, or make
the fused and non-fused paths bit-identical.

**Default decision (maintainer, 2026-10-10): fusions stay default-ON, unchanged.**  The divergence is a
pre-existing property of the arena, not of the ring, and disabling the fusions would cost more than it
fixes — see the measured cost and the re-enable recipe in `ENVIRONMENT.md` §7.

### 51. 3-GPU MTP decode is 2.6x SLOWER than plain decode (pre-existing)

**Working home: `wip/moe-verify-fusions/`** (tracked together with #50 — the maintainer suspects a shared root cause on the cache-band routed-MMVQ verify path).

**Opened 2026-10-10 (found during the `archive/work/slab-ring-region/` 3-GPU gate).**  On 3 GPUs MTP is a *loss*,
not a win — and it hits the production config (AGENTS.md: servers run unpinned, 3-GPU,
`HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2`, hybrid default).

Field config, Qwen3.8-Flash-Next IQ4_NL + the shared Q8_0 MTP head, 32 358-token prompt, 1000 generated,
`--spec-draft-n-max 3`, same tree:

| config | prefill | decode | acceptance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2-GPU plain (`--spec-type none`) | 546 | 41.9 | — |
| 2-GPU MTP | 961 | **64.8** | 0.91 |
| 3-GPU plain | — | **52.2** | — |
| 3-GPU MTP | 1043 | **19.5** | 0.90 |
| 3-GPU MTP, ring off (`GGML_CUDA_SLAB_RING_MIB=0`) | 759 | 21.4 | 0.91 |
| **3-GPU MTP, clean r38 (no WIP patch)** | 768 | **20.1** | — |
| **3-GPU plain, clean r38** | 927 | **53.0** | — |

The verify step costs ~190 ms on 3 GPUs against ~57 ms on 2.  **Reproduces on clean r38**, so it is not the
H2D-ring WIP (and `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=ce` vs the hybrid default makes no difference; `ce` is 2-GPU-only
anyway, ENVIRONMENT §6).  Also orthogonal to the cache residency (3-GPU logs 99.1 % residency).

**Reproducer:**

```bash
cd /tmp/srr   # field.sh; field3.sh = same without the forced GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=ce;
              # field_nospec.sh = field3.sh with --spec-type none and no --spec-draft-model
PROMPT=/tmp/srr/mixed30k.txt GPUS=0,1,2 ./field3.sh      ~/llama.cpp/build-rocm-hybrid t3 run30kfit
PROMPT=/tmp/srr/mixed30k.txt GPUS=0,1,2 ./field_nospec.sh ~/llama.cpp/build-rocm-hybrid t3n run30kfit
```

Suspects to start from: the 3-way tensor-split verify gather (the 4-token verify reads experts from three
devices), the draft/target device placement, and whether the per-op graph capture re-fires on 3 GPUs
(`graphs reused` is 267 on 3 GPUs vs 246/270 on 2).  Details: `archive/work/slab-ring-region/HANDOVER.md` §4.3.1.

### 52. Multi-sequence MTP is non-deterministic: a rollback reads a recurrent snapshot the last batch did not write — CORRECTNESS

**Working home: `wip/moe-verify-fusions/`** (found 2026-10-12 while investigating the single-sequence
divergence — see [`HANDOVER-single-seq-rollback.md`](wip/moe-verify-fusions/HANDOVER-single-seq-rollback.md)).

**Symptom.**  `llama-server -np 2 --kv-unified --spec-type draft-mtp`, two concurrent greedy requests (A
long keeps decoding after B short finishes): the output is **not reproducible across identical
repetitions**, and the long request differs when concurrent vs solo.  This violates the per-sequence
independence the delivery already asserts (`test-recurrent-state-rollback`'s "seq-1-only decode
independent of seq 0", max diff 0).

**Reproduced on our r39 + narrow-2 build with NO PR #124 skip**, so it is **not** caused by PR #124
(whose reporter's "reference" is our tree's shape).  The run logs the invalid-rollback condition, verbatim:

```
seq_rm: rollback crossed a batch boundary: seq 1 rollback=2 but the last batch decoded 6136 tokens
        (last pos 18419, n_rs_seq=3, n_rs_batch=4). ... the restored state is wrong
```

i.e. a verify rejection rollback lands while the last decoded batch was a large prefill batch, and the
recurrent snapshot path reads a snapshot that batch never wrote (§27's invariant).

**Controls run (all on 2 GPU, GSQ + shared Q8_0 MTP):** identical under `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=ce` (so not
the all-reduce); `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0` removes the snapshot substance but the instability **survives**
(so there is a second, batching-level component); concurrent repetitions still differ.  Note the warning
is emitted **once per process** (a `static` flag), so a later occurrence is silent — do not rely on the
log alone.

**Reproducer:** `wip/moe-verify-fusions/tools/multiseq.sh <build_dir> <tag>` (env `GPUS`/`M`/`D`), e.g.
`GPUS=0,1 ./multiseq.sh ~/llama.cpp/build-rocm-hybrid msq`.

**Fix direction (not yet chosen):** the §27 invariant — *every batch that can be rolled back into must
run the kernel that writes the snapshots it will read*.  Either (a) never present a verify rollback whose
`last_ubatch_nseq_tokens > n_rs_batch` (server/batching), (b) write the pre-batch plane for the chunked
prefill when a rollback can follow it, or (c) pin the rollback into the batch's own snapshot.  Confirm
with a matrix (2-seq × prefill-in-flight × `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED`) and re-check the reporter's PR #124
scenario before that PR is ever merged.

### 48. The MoE expert cache corrupts a wide MTP-export consumer (G7) — CORRECTNESS

**ROOT-CAUSED, FIXED, GATED 2026-10-09 (WIP patch).**  The handover's alias/take-over hypothesis was
wrong: the skip is in the SAME split.  On the 1-GPU reproducer, `blk.47`'s weight has **two `MUL_MAT_ID`
consumers in one split** (the 0-row gathered logits tail and the 15-row unmasked MTP export); the scheduler
picked the first (0-row), hit `ggml_nelements(ids) == 0 -> continue`, and never filled the copy the export
reads.  The wide export never redirects to the arena (`moe_cache_get_table` declines every `ne[2] > band`), so
it read the unfilled copy -> NaN in `t_h_nextn`.

**Fix:** in `ggml_backend_sched_compute_splits`, count the `MUL_MAT_ID` consumers of the input copy; when
there is more than one, skip both the cache takeover and the pruned fill and copy the whole table.
Patch `archive/work/fit-slab-accounting/g7-multi-consumer-fill.patch` (46 lines, `ggml/src/ggml-backend.cpp`, sha256
`a041a4d8b4fc81c83ce2b0101e9336a088a3493e04ce4b3a9da815a81b3b9b84`).  Full handover, evidence and gates:
`archive/work/fit-slab-accounting/README.md` §13.6.

**Gates PASS:** acceptance **0.57353** for `-ncmoe {44,48,99}` (0 NaN); dense 4B `1c5d32ac537d`;
prefill-logit KLD **0.000707 / 98.755 %**; `MUL_MAT_ID` 931/931; 2-GPU GSQ r5 repro acceptance **0.72727**,
0 NaN.  **Next:** promote through block 06 (the scheduler half of the cache) — `patches/` is untouched by
this campaign.

**DELIVERED in `v16-a55e952b8-r38` (block 06).**  Original handover: `--spec-type draft-mtp` on Flash-Next (separate `-md`
head) can collapse draft acceptance to **0** with **NaN** draft logits while the target text stays
coherent.  Isolated to the cache: `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=0` gives acceptance 0.588 and no NaN;
`GGML_OP_OFFLOAD_MIN_BATCH=100000` does not help; `-ncmoe 44` is fine, `-ncmoe 48` NaNs.  The qwen4exp
unmasked MTP export recomputes the last trunk layer's FFN on every row, so `blk.47.ffn_*_exps` has a
1-row decode-band consumer (whose copy `moe_cache_take_over` aliases to the arena and never fills) and a
wide export consumer that reads the same unfilled copy -> NaN in `t_h_nextn`.  The r5 `sched-moe-restage`
fix (`ggml-backend.cpp:1826`) is present but insufficient for this 1-GPU/`-sm layer`/`n_copies==1` config.
**Next:** prove the exact skip (ids-not-ready at staging time vs the copy-pointer alias map surviving
across graphs), then pick a fix from the four candidates.  Full handover, reproducer and gates:
`archive/work/fit-slab-accounting/README.md` §13.

### 47. Bring the MoE arena budget and slab headroom into `--fit` (G1 + G2)

**RETESTED 2026-10-09 (post-G7, r37 + revival).**  The Phase 1 patch applies to the current tree with
offsets; **the auto floor under `-sm tensor` no longer corrupts** (2/2 auto runs coherent, no arena
thrash — the Phase 1 `////` + `moe_cache_rearm` is gone).  Three re-cut fixes: the G2 CUDA getter was
**inert on r37** (`ggml_cuda_slab_enabled()` is `env_on && g_slab_armed`, false at fit time); and the
host-expert map attributed all 56762 MiB to device 0, so the MIB/auto floor reserved device 0 only — the
loader now distributes each `exps` tensor across the layer Meta device's simple devices, so G1 reserves
**both** devices (`20108 / 20110` MiB) and the post-prefill drop/rearm loop covers device 1.  Decisions:
the MIB is a **cap** (built arena must be 95-100 % of it), **G2 gate = b1**, and the **full §5.1-§5.7
matrix must pass before release** (no-abort MIB sweep, dense golden `1c5d32ac537d`, `GGML_CUDA_SLAB=0`
zeroes G2 are green).  Record + arms: `archive/work/fit-slab-accounting/README.md` §14.4; combined current-state
patch `fit-slab-r37-all-wip.patch`.  **Ordered release plan: README §15** (purity/determinism first, then
`ENVIRONMENT.md`, the full §5.1-§5.7 matrix, `fingon`, and promotion).

**DELIVERED in `v16-a55e952b8-r38` (block 06).**  `--fit` now reserves the MoE-arena budget and the
slab headroom; the auto floor under `-sm tensor` no longer corrupts, and per-device host-expert
accounting covers every device.  Record: `archive/work/fit-slab-accounting/README.md` §14.4/§15; `WORKLOG.md`
2026-10-09 (r38).  *(Phase 1 history, kept for context.)*

**Opened 2026-10-07; Phase 1 implemented then PARKED 2026-10-07.**  `--fit` is not a single VRAM planner for
ROCm: (G1) an explicit `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB` is invisible to the fit margin, so the context is sized as
if the arena did not exist; (G2) the slab's `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_HEADROOM_MIB` (4096, a HARD floor because
hipBLASLt loads Tensile code objects + workspace behind the app's back and cannot be routed into the slab)
is not modelled, and the `--fit-target` default (1 GiB) is smaller than it — the `exit 134` class.
Phase 1 (G1 + G2 + the tensor-split plumbing they need) was **implemented, built warning-free and tested**:
G2 (headroom) and G1 (explicit MIB) are safe, but newly enabling the **auto floor** under `-sm tensor`
reproducibly corrupts (2/2; `!!!!!!!!` output, arena thrash) — a latent layout-dependent bug the fix
exposes.  **PARKED** by the maintainer; the patch + full matrix + the open root-cause are in
`archive/work/fit-slab-accounting/PHASE1-ATTEMPT.md`.  `patches/` was never touched.  **Do NOT** recommend
disabling hipBLASLt (corrupt at a thin headroom, stunted at 4096).  To revisit: ship the safe subset
(headroom + explicit MIB, auto floor off under `-sm tensor`) or root-cause the corruption first.
Full handover: `archive/work/fit-slab-accounting/README.md`.

### 46. Re-cut PR #106 patch 0002 (data-pointer graph key) against the slab

**Opened 2026-10-07** when r25 dropped the patch.  The patch hashes every node's and source's `data`
pointer into `ggml_cuda_graph_key` so the alternating MTP verify/draft layouts each keep their own captured
graph.  It was written against r17 and is a **regression on the r22+ movable-boundary slab**: per-device
allocations vary between otherwise-identical calls, so the extra key component invalidates warm graphs and
they are recaptured (3x R9700, qwen4exp UD-IQ3_XXS + shared Q8_0 MTP, `-sm tensor -ub 2048`: 41.8 vs 51.8
t/s at `--spec-draft-p-min 0.5`; 88.2 vs 94.9 at p-min 0; text and acceptance identical either way).
**Next:** re-cut it so the key is stable (e.g. hash a per-tensor layout/version id the allocator guarantees
rather than a raw address), then A/B it on the `-sm tensor` MTP config.  The contributor may also re-cut it.
Record: `WORKLOG.md` 2026-10-07 (r25); PR #106.

### 36. Genuine CPU/GPU overlap for the MoE misses (Strata's pipeline shape)

**Opened 2026-10-05; scoping only.**  The delivered cache-on path computes every expert on the GPU
(resident from VRAM, misses via UVA over PCIe); the cache-off path computes them on the CPU but
**serialised** with the GPU splits.  Our own CPU-computes-misses arm was correct and negative above a
~1.2 GiB arena (the loss is ~600 scheduler dispatches + ~3 cross-backend copies per layer/token, not
CPU compute; see `archive/work/moe-expert-cache/WORKLOG.md`).  Strata's custom engine runs the CPU pool
*because* it is not under llama.cpp's serial scheduler.  **Next:** O0 - measure how much of a 52 t/s
token is the UVA cold fraction at 43 % residency; if it is <20 %, park it.  Design space and gates:
`wip/moe-cpu-overlap/README.md`.

### 35. Audit Strata's AMD decode kernels against our block-10/13/15 kernels

**Opened 2026-10-05; scoping only.**  Candidates: #262 packed-byte IQ dequant (Strata measured R9700
decode +15 %), `router_top10` fast FP32 router (62.4 -> 70), `fused_gr` LDS carveout, arena transparent
huge pages, and the #646 IQ-grid-staging choice.  Our decode is partly UVA-bound at 43 % residency, so
the honest end-to-end targets are the fully-resident and multi-GPU cases; the kernels are still in
scope (RDNA4 HIP) and several are upstream-PR shaped.  **Next:** K0 - line-by-line kernel diff and a
shortlist with expected deltas.  Record: `wip/strata-amd-kernels/README.md`.

### 33. PR #104 follow-ups: cross-backend event wait and per-change kill-switches

**Opened 2026-10-05; both landed in `v16-a55e952b8-r12`, non-blocking.**  The block-06 fix adds a
`ggml_backend_event_wait(input_backend, event)` where the event was created on `split_backend`, the
scheduler's first cross-backend event wait.  Several backends implement `event_wait` assuming their
own event object (`ggml_backend_sycl_event_wait` does a `static_cast<sycl::event*>`, Vulkan casts to
`vk_event*`, Metal to `ggml_metal_event_t`); on a scheduler that mixes device backends this is at
best a host block and at worst an abort.  The delivery is CUDA/meta/CPU only today, so it is not hit
now.  **Next:** add a same-family guard (or a per-backend foreign-event capability).  Separately,
neither block-06 nor block-13 change has a per-change env kill-switch (the WIP promotion rule);
`GGML_SCHED_EVENTS=0` disables the block-06 fix only by turning off all per-split events, at a
measured prefill cost.  Record: `archive/work/2gpu-sched-fixes/VERIFICATION.md`.

### 32. `gdn-conv.cu` device idiom (block 15; found in the PR #102 review)

**Opened 2026-10-04; cosmetic, no correctness impact.**  `gdn_conv_check` gates the 2..255-token arm
on `ggml_cuda_info().devices[ggml_cuda_get_device()].cc`, while the batched-copy path added by PR #102
uses `ggml_cuda_info().devices[ctx.device].cc`.  They agree on every current graph because the device
is set before `ggml_cuda_try_fuse` runs, so it is two idioms for the same thing.  **Next:** pick one
(pass the context device into the check, or use `ggml_cuda_get_device()` consistently) at the next
block-15 touch.  Record: `archive/work/rdna4-verify-fusions-lf/VERIFICATION-r10.md` (review notes).

### 31. PR #100: three verify-step fusions (GLU -> Q8_1, GDN VCONV, batched CPY)

**Opened 2026-10-04; accepted as a WIP record, NOT promoted.**  Contributor PR
[#100](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/pull/100) (@overdoingism) adds three
default-on verify-step fusions, each with a kill switch, in `archive/work/rdna4-verify-fusions-lf/`:
`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GLU_Q8_1` (a verify-step GLU also writes the next mmvq's Q8_1), `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GDN_CONV_VERIFY`
(the fused GDN concat + conv for 2..255-token batches) and `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH` (consecutive
same-layout f32 CPY nodes in one launch).  (The #100 revision used the `GGML_LF_*` names.)

Review on r10 (test worktree `/home/stew675/llama-pr100`): applies cleanly and builds warning-free;
output is byte-identical on 35B-A3B Q8_0 MTP n3 (`8d733a56c740`) and 27B Q4_K_XL MTP n3
(`1acb04bd9104`, the recorded 27B gate) for fusions on == off == r10 baseline, with and without
verify graphs; the batched-copy fusion fires and runs (150/528 runs).  Measured throughput is ~flat
(27B 53.6 vs 52.9 t/s, 35B 143.2 vs 141.5 on vs off), so the win is unproven.

**Before promotion:** (1) the `GGML_LF_GLU_Q8_CHECK=1` self-check is broken: it does a host sync
under graph capture (`operation not permitted when stream is capturing`) and, with verify graphs
disabled, perturbs the output (22079 vs 113 chars), so it is not a valid oracle; (2) the GLU fusion
mark is file-static cross-node state passed from `ggml_cuda_try_fuse` to the launcher (fragile,
single-threaded); (3) the `lf-*` / "Llama-Frankenstein" naming and AI-authored comments need
normalising; (4) the PR body has no measurements; (5) VCONV relaxes a kernel precondition
(`T >= 256` -> `T >= 2`) that needs a geometry sweep; (6) no arch gate despite the RDNA4 title;
(7) the overlap with the existing fusion machinery needs review as a whole.  The author has been
offered the chance to refine the PR first; otherwise it is a lower-priority item to pick up later.
Record: `archive/work/rdna4-verify-fusions-lf/`.

**Follow-up:** contributor [PR #102](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/pull/102)
(opened 2026-10-04) supersedes the #100 patch with a revised `verify-fusions.patch` built on r10,
plus a geometry sweep (`vf_sweep.cpp`) and a rewritten README.  It removes the broken `_CHECK`
self-check, moves the GLU mark into the CUDA context, normalises the naming and adds RDNA4 gates.
**Verified 2026-10-04** against r10 (worktree `/home/stew675/llama-fix97`, branch `pr102-review`,
build `build-pr102`): applies cleanly (tree `38ebce2f`), builds warning-free, and the 16,130-case
`vf_sweep` is bit-identical across fusions on, fusions off and stock r10, with all three fusions
confirmed firing (rocprof counts match the PR).  The end-to-end DFlash gate is byte-identical
on == off == stock r10 (`55824e640aa0`).  All #100 review points are addressed.

**A/B 2026-10-04 (the effect size is now settled):** Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q4_K_XL + DFlash2, q8_0 KV,
`-ub 512`, `-n 512`, WikiText-2 prefixes at 8.3K / 35.2K / 110.4K tokens, alternating on/off runs on
the same binary.  Every on run beat every off run: **+1.51 % (5/5)**, **+1.56 % (5/5)**,
**+1.31 % (3/3)**; generated text byte-identical within each depth.  So the win is real and larger
than the earlier single-run spread suggested.  Under the default-on policy the patch is
promotion-ready (block 15 is the natural home); promotion itself is the maintainer's call.

### 30. Default-flip the DFlash device-resident layer features (PR #73) — **CLOSED 2026-10-07 (r26)**

**Opened 2026-09-30** with r27.  PR #73's device path (`GGML_LF_DFLASH_DEV=1`) is now validated on
gfx1201 as output-identical to the host path and faster (`Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2-Q4_K_M`, 27B
UD-Q4_K_XL, q8_0 KV, 5246-token prompt: `GGML_LF_DFLASH_DEV=0` and `=1` both give
`487 chars sha=dad22c4270ab`; prefill 1144.2 -> 1232.5 t/s, generation 63.8 -> 65.4 t/s).  It stays
opt-in because the device buffer allocation (`llama_context::extract_layer_inputs`) is a hard
`GGML_ASSERT` on failure: a nearly-full card aborts instead of falling back.  **Next:** give the
allocation the same warn-once-and-fall-back treatment as the FA staging arena (issue #33), then flip
the default on with `GGML_LF_DFLASH_DEV=0` as the kill switch.  Record: `WORKLOG.md` 2026-09-30 (r27).

**Maintainer note 2026-10-04:** DFlash2 was compared against the delivery's adaptive MTP across the
broad matrix and adaptive MTP came out ahead, so this is a **support** item (get the DFlash2 path
working correctly, without the hard assert), not a performance priority.  The device-resident default
flip is therefore lower value than the original r27 note implies; keep it for completeness.

**CLOSED 2026-10-07 (r26):** contributor PR #107 (@overdoingism) gives the allocation the
warn-once-and-fall-back treatment (the host buffers are always reserved, so the fallback needs no
extra memory) and flips F1 default-on for single-sequence DFlash, with the runtime
`GGML_LF_DFLASH_DEV=0` kill switch.  Folded into block 15; `WORKLOG.md` 2026-10-07 (r26).

### 29. The address-selected `ROPE -> VIEW -> SET_ROWS` fusion decides the W=1 decode logits (issue #58 item D)

**Opened 2026-09-29** while analysing issue #58 item D (cross-start greedy nondeterminism, @DanoPTT,
gfx1201 / Windows / ROCm 10).  `ggml_cuda_check_fusion_memory_ranges()` selects the fusion by buffer-address
overlap; the fused path is not proven bit-transparent, so the decode logits are a function of the allocation
plan.  Logits-level bisect on gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14 (`Qwen3.8-27B-Q6_K`, `test-logits-width-probe`, P=256,
W=1 row-0): default `f6d62323d9339541`; `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_FUSION=1`, all-address-gated-fusions-off, and
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_ROPE_SET_ROWS=1` all give `3ab223a4f08afd6e`; `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_RMS_NORM_MUL_ROPE=1`,
the other per-fusion switches, graphs and `FA_KV_NATIVE` do not move it.  20/20 fresh Linux starts agree
(the layout is stable here).  Not yet separated: whether the fused `rope_multi` kernel itself differs, or
its elided F32 buffer re-addresses a neighbouring fusion.  **Next:** isolate the kernel (a focused
`rope -> view -> set_rows` backend test or a forced-fire probe), then either make the fused path bit-exact
or stop the guard deciding by raw address.  Switches shipped default-off in `v16-84e76d8a2-r24` (block 15).

### 28. Retune the RDNA4 dense mmvq rows-per-block table for `q5_1` / `iq4_xs` on ROCm 7.14

**Opened 2026-09-28** while integrating PR #57 (now in `v16-84e76d8a2-r21`, blocks 10+13).  The per-type
`calc_rows_per_block_weight` table was swept by the author on **ROCm 10.0**; on the maintainer's **ROCm
7.14** build it transfers for the main types (q3_K +7..+24 %, q4_K +8..+38 %, q6_K +3..+27 %, q2_K +14 %
at n=1) but carries two small dips: **`q5_1` -3..-4 %** and **`iq4_xs` -3..-4 %** at n=2/3 -- both
**+10..+12 %** at n=8, and the common MTP/DFlash verify widths are 4 and 8.  Kept as tuned (the aggregate
band is a large net win); a per-type retune (e.g. 1 row for these two at 2..3 columns) needs its own
verify-width A/B.  Record: `wip/mmvq-verify-rows/VERIFICATION-r21.md`, `WORKLOG.md` 2026-09-28 (r21,
PR #57).

### 27. Extend the RDNA4 GQA-6 FA band's 64-wide K/V row to the 2-byte (f16/bf16) arm

**Opened 2026-09-28** while integrating PR #62 (now in `v16-84e76d8a2-r21`, block 15).  The new band-only
MMA config row (`fattn-mma-f16.cuh`: `is_rdna4 && ncols2 == 8 && DKQ == DV == 256 && ncols == 32`) matches
only the **native-quantized** arm (`ncols1 = 4`).  The 2-byte f16/bf16 arm uses `ncols1 = 2`
(`ggml_cuda_fattn_band_wmma_ncols1`) -> `ncols = 16`, so it keeps the old 128-half2 row.  The PR README's
"f16 3-4 %" is therefore **misattributed** (measured f16 KV `tg128 @ d16384` 27.50 -> 27.57, noise).  A
64-wide row for the 2-byte arm is worth a sweep: the arm has no dequantisation to hide the unused
columns, and r6 made native bf16 default-on so the arm is live.  Record:
`archive/work/rdna4-fa-band/VERIFICATION-r21.md`, `WORKLOG.md` 2026-09-28 (r21, PR #62).

## Waiting on others (not actionable in this repo)

### 6. Cross-arch / gfx1100 validation (the gfx1201 port + its Phase 2.5 probe are DONE — see `WORKLOG.md`)
- **Still open, needs other hardware:**
  * gfx1100 (`fingon`, 24 GiB): the §4.2 remainder with *no* gfx1100 data yet — the GDN gfx11 NW16 scan
    retune (~106K VGPR/CU vs a possible 64K classic), `split_j`/config rows, the quantize chunk,
    routed-compact, the hc/PLE fusions, and the two block-13 MTP regression fixes under RDNA3
    (acceptance gate).
  * gfx1100 q8_0 native-arm prefill trade (2026-09-18, r5): the block-15 q8_0 native arm costs ~5 %
    of gemma-4-26B-A4B head-512 deep prefill on gfx1100 (773 vs 813 t/s `pp2048 @ d98304` with
    `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE=0`, stock 810) but buys +44 % decode at d65536, so it stays on.  The
    dense head-256 model is unaffected (1405.9 vs 1404.4).  Candidate fix: keep native decode but
    restore node-scratch F16 staging for prefill on RDNA3_0.  See `WORKLOG.md` 2026-09-18 (r5).
  * gfx1151 (`halo`): Phase 3's cross-arch fingerprint check (gfx1201 == gfx1151 numerics) — a
    verification goal, not a port; also item 7's MTP crossover re-measure (item 4 is closed).
- **Tracker hygiene:** the plan's own open checkboxes are **stale** (Phase 1 is complete and the doc
  predates qwen4exp's promotion to block 14); read the banner at the top of
  `archive/work/qwen4exp/gfx1201-porting.md` before trusting them.

### 8. Dual 7900XTX (gfx1100, community): block-12 validation
- Hybrid HIP all-reduce on RDNA3 **pairs** is being validated by a community member on their dual-7900XTX
  box (hybrid-dispatch matrix internal/nccl/none + the bounded-spin path at depth-16384).  The block-12
  arch gate stays RDNA4-only until then.  Volunteer env: `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=internal`.
- The block-13 gfx1100 leg is DONE (single-GPU 7900 XTX; see the `WORKLOG.md` entry); what remains here is block 12, which
  is N/A on a single-GPU box.  Where: `patches/0012` + the block-12 notes in `patches/README.md`.

### 12. Upstream: file the staged PR candidates
- `upstream/README.md` — five are written up and evidence-verified on pristine master `9cf3bf256`:
  the ggml-alloc unused-view release, the sched probe, the keys-only indexer cache (A1), the `attn_k`
  null-mask guard (A2), plus `UPSTREAM-PR-fa-decode-verify-kernel-family.{md,patch}` (the F1 chooser fix,
  whose NVIDIA/Ada half the fork deliberately does not land — see the AGENTS.md scope policy).
- Filing is the maintainer's call.

## Documented, deliberately NOT fixed (accepted limitations — do not re-report)

- **The `launch-ledger` remainder (item 5(c)) — measured, not pursued (2026-09-12 (8)).**  The small-pp
  remainder (+38 `scale_f32`/eval, an `rms_norm<256,true>` count diff) is sub-0.2 %, root-cause-only.
- **The mmq mma `sum[]` accumulator-overflow latent defect (item 5(d)) — accepted, no upstream report
  (2026-09-12 (8)).**  `process_tile` sizes the per-thread accumulator as `J*I/(nwarps*32)` while the
  AMD-WMMA vec_dot indexes up to `J/2-1`, so any config with `I < nwarps*16` silently corrupts
  (deterministic for J=128, racy for J=48/24).  Root cause + full evidence matrix:
  `archive/work/wip-archive/qwen4exp/discovery/2026-09-06-strix-halo-gfx1151-mmq-j128-latent-defect.md`.  Upstream
  ships **no** violating config (every `mmq-config-*.cuh` row keeps `I >= nwarps*16`) and the block-13
  rows never violate it either, so there is no upstream reproducer to file.
- **V3 prefill cost is arch-dependent (item 5(g)) — accepted.**  gfx1151 measured −3.2 % at pp20480
  (4B, q8_0) vs the RDNA4 reference −1.3 %, decode flat; still a large net win (−799 MiB compute +
  −799 MiB host) and on by default.
- **Upstream monitor: ROCm unaligned-width split-load (item 13) — standing, no action (2026-09-12 (8)).**
  Fixed locally in block 13; no PR planned (upstream is busy with its own qwen4exp work).  It resolves
  naturally as a re-base conflict if upstream fixes it; nothing to track.

- **Mixed K/V cache types fall off the GPU attention path.**  Any mixed pair (`bf16`+`q8_0`, `f16`+`q8_0`)
  gives `graph splits = 18`, a ~1.5 GiB host compute buffer and pp2048 7924 → 640–1049 t/s on the 4B.
  Maintainer policy (2026-09-11): **reject differing K/V types** — every mixed pair is 1.7–3.6× slower
  and never smaller; upstream already enforces same-K/V for DeepSeek V4 (#25871).  **Decided and
  implemented 2026-09-11 (12): hard-rejected at context creation** — `params.type_k != params.type_v`
  now fails `llama_init_from_model` with a message naming both types and telling the user to set
  `--cache-type-v` to match (block-14 amendment; upstream's MLA/DeepSeek4-only condition is dropped).
  Both types default to f16, so only an explicit `--cache-type-k`/`-v` can trigger it.
- **gemma-4-E4B-it + 3-GPU `-sm tensor`** aborts in the meta splitter (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp:1177`)
  because its 2 KV heads are fewer than the 3 devices (one device gets a zero-extent share).  Works on
  1/2 GPUs and on 3 GPUs with `-sm layer`; maintainer's call: no fix.  Every other model is unaffected
  (a future block or upstream report could make the splitter tolerate a zero-extent share).
- **`src/llama-kv-cache.h:274` `-Wunused-private-field` for `v_enabled`** on a full build (the field *is*
  used, in `llama-kv-cache.cpp:232`; clang's per-TU analysis fires).  A `[[maybe_unused]]` one-liner
  silences it; left alone to keep the V5 amendment scoped to the FA kernels.
- **Not worth pursuing** (measured, no win): the decode fq-inline-quantize port (wash-to-negative — the
  tree already launches fewer kernels/step and sits at wall parity) and the GDN +72-launch 2-kernel split
  (cosmetic).

## Parked (not planned now)
- **`rdna-boosts-all.patch` hygiene (raised 2026-09-15).**  The single-file net patch is a documented
  delivery artifact (1.35 MiB) that is regenerated on every release, so each revision adds ~1.3 MiB of
  history — the dominant `.git` cost (the raw logs trimmed 2026-09-15 compressed to only ~1.07 MiB total,
  so history is otherwise compact).  Options when someone picks this up: (a) keep as-is (it is derivable
  from `patches/` + `scripts/apply-all.sh`, so it is pure convenience); (b) stop tracking it and generate
  it on demand in the release pipeline / for the GitHub Release asset (the layout table and
  `docker-ghcr.yml` both reference it, so those pointers move); (c) a history rewrite
  (`git filter-repo` + force-push + re-tagging every `v16-*`) — measure the real recovery first: the
  patch is already close to incompressible text, so the win is bounded and the cost is a force-push to a
  published repo (see the Pushing policy).  **Not today; no work started.**
- **Restore the block-13 RDNA3_5 single-token fusion perf (item 16).**  The ~0.9 % `tg128` the purity
  skip costs; the proposed "pin `nwarps`/`rps`/item-split" fix is **invalid** (the two arms are already
  launch-identical).  Live candidates: codegen (`has_fusion` register pressure / FMA contraction) and the
  Q8_1 cache.  Low priority — the skip is the accepted purity trade.  `archive/work/strix-halo/rdna35-mmvq-fusion-purity/README.md` §9.
- **`-Wshadow` cleanup for `src/` (item 15).**  Audited: 128 warnings / 27 files, 46 in the risky
  "shadows a local variable" class.  Wants a dedicated cleanup commit (~20 upstream files) to avoid
  colliding on every re-base.  `archive/work/shadow-warnings/RECORD-2026-09-12-shadow-audit.md`.
- **MoE topk fusion adoption (item 5(a)).**  ~0.5 % prefill for a ~188 MB arena cost and a numerics fork
  (fused top1 logit 18.424 -> 18.690 vs the unfused reference), so it needs a quality gate before it can
  be trusted.  `archive/work/wip-archive/qwen4exp/discovery/2026-09-06-strix-halo-gfx1151-launch-overhead-topk.md`.
- **`ssm_alpha` + `ssm_beta` single-walk fusion (item 5(b)).**  ~0.3-0.6 % prefill, blocked by the graph
  expansion order (the two MMs are non-adjacent) -> needs a graph restructure or load-time stacked
  weights.  `archive/work/wip-archive/qwen4exp/discovery/2026-09-06-strix-halo-gfx1151-cijk-dense-gemm.md`.

### LFRU host→GPU slow hot-weight migration
- Survivor of the expert-tiering experiment (dropped 2026-09-05 — most of its aims are already covered by
  current llama.cpp options).  The one idea left: an LFRU-style very slow migration of hot weights from
  host to GPU (persistent GPU slot cache + CPU-computed cold tail).  Design notes:
  `archive/work/qwen4exp/LRU_EXPERTS.md`, `PHASE0_ROUTING.md`, `HANDOVER-2026-09-04-tiering.md`.

## Parked: finish the meta segmented expert upload (host-resident experts under `-sm tensor`)

`llm_arch_supports_sm_tensor()` no longer rejects `LLM_ARCH_GEMMA4` outright (r9, issue #99): an
all-resident or `-ngl`-offloaded gemma4 splits under `-sm tensor`, and only a host-resident expert
table (`-ncmoe`/`-cmoe`, detected in `llama_model_create`) and the MTP head (`gemma4-assistant`) are
rejected.  The remaining work is the segmented per-ubatch upload for a host-resident expert table:
gemma4's fused expert tensor (`ffn_gate_up_exps`) has a segmented split layout (`n_segments`/`nr`),
and `ggml_backend_meta_set_tensor_async` only handles a contiguous slice, so the MMQ tail pad that
`copy_experts` appends makes the range non-row-aligned.

A partial fix exists but is **not** landed (it hung non-deterministically, one GPU spinning): port
`ggml_backend_meta_buffer_set_tensor`'s segmented handling into the async setter, copy the
row-aligned part through the segments and the <=512-byte pad as a flat per-device range, and use
per-row 1-D async sets instead of the 2-D pageable `hipMemcpy2DAsync` (which faults on this shape).
Give it a deterministic repro (e.g. `compute-sanitizer`, or the `GGML_CUDA_SPLICE_GATHER` /
`GGML_META_PINHOST` force-modes) before retrying.  All of it is in
`archive/work/moe-expert-cache/item3-findings-session20.md`; the issue-#99 gate change is in
`archive/work/issue-99/README.md`.
