# WORKLOG - dated delivery records

## 2026-10-08 (r36) -- prefill work from three contributor PRs (#119, #121, #122) folded into blocks 06, 09, 15

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r36`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip **`8e28631f6`**,
net tree **`d55aebfe0d7af530aa485ffd7ebf5e1dce331b08`** (strict **16/16** `git am`, `validate-set.sh`
green).  Block count stays **16**: PR #119 and PR #121 are folded into **block 15** (the MoE-cache campaign
block, which defines `ggml_backend_cuda_stage_gather`), PR #122 patch 0001 into **block 06** and patch 0002
into **block 09**.  The folded tree is byte-identical to r35 + the four patches (verified with `git write-tree`
against a reference worktree).

### Why

Three `wip/` PRs from @briansp2020, measured on the 3x R9700 (PCIe5 x4) and 2-GPU configs against the
GSQ-RCO IQ3_XXS build:

* **PR #119 (`wip/bf16-src1-reuse`)** -- the qwen4exp hc mixer feeds one F32 `xn` to two BF16 cuBLAS GEMMs
  (`hc_down`, `hc_inject`); convert it to BF16 once per graph instead of once per GEMM.  Bit identical;
  prefill only (multi-token, `>= 64` columns).  GSQ model (hc_inject BF16), 3 GPUs, all experts in VRAM,
  pp2048: `-sm tensor` 1786.6 -> 1864.7 t/s (+4.4 %), `-sm layer` 1561.4 -> 1628.3 (+4.3 %).  The unsloth
  UD-IQ3_XXS build gains only +1.1 to +1.6 % because its `hc_inject` is F32, so only the
  `hc_combine_norm` producer half of the patch fires.
* **PR #121 (`wip/moe-cache-inplace`)** -- with `-ncmoe` host experts the MoE cache staged every routed
  expert table whole for each prefill ubatch; read the compact table in place instead (arena when resident,
  pinned host master otherwise), with a zero-padded tail guard for MMQ's one-tile over-read.  Server
  prefill, 2 GPUs, `--n-cpu-moe 48`: 2.9k 431.8 -> 1214.1 t/s and 61k 1005.1 -> 2471.6 (`-sm tensor`);
  2.9k 491.4 -> 1460.8 and 61k 682.3 -> 1998.3 (`-sm layer -ts 59,41`).  Greedy output identical to r35 at
  2.9k and 61k (3 reps each).  The in-place path needs the cache to be sized by a decode-band pass first;
  a decode-free prefill never primes it (primer: it also needs the arena to be sized).
* **PR #122 (`wip/moe-cache-layer-split-fixes`)** -- 0001 keeps a free-VRAM floor (512 MiB) on the workspace
  pool's first attempt while the cache holds host experts (`GGML_CUDA_POOL_MIN_FREE_MIB`), so the flush +
  retry runs; 0002 asks the slab for at least 6 GiB of headroom under `-sm layer` when every cache table is
  unsplit and spans more than one device.  Standalone (symbol-verified: no PR #119/#121 code): r35 baseline
  OOMs at 255k under both `-sm layer -ts 59,41` and `-sm tensor`; r36 survives both (682 / 1010 t/s
  prefill).  61k `-sm layer -ts 59,41` greedy decode is bit-identical to r35 (`251702d5ebf6`).  The
  specific "broken greedy decode after a 61k prefill" symptom did not reproduce on r35 (both reps coherent),
  likely because r35 already folded the slab peer-access fix, so 0001 is a safety floor rather than a fix for
  a live r35 symptom on this box; 0002 is the active 255k fix.

### What landed

* **block 15**: PR #119 and PR #121.  New switches `GGML_CUDA_BF16_SRC1_CACHE`, `GGML_MOE_CACHE_INPLACE`,
  `GGML_MOE_CACHE_STAGE` (all default on, set to `0` to restore r35).
* **block 06**: PR #122 patch 0001.  New `moe_cache_floor_active()` and `GGML_CUDA_POOL_MIN_FREE_MIB`.
* **block 09**: PR #122 patch 0002.  New `ggml_cuda_slab_headroom_at_least_mib()` (6 GiB under `-sm layer`).

### Validation

`validate-set.sh` green (fresh-tarball strict 16/16 apply, applied tree == `release.json`).

* dense `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` `-sm tensor` same-seed `1c5d32ac537d` (r35-identical);
* `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` OK (4/4 backends);
* prefill-logit KLD **0.000707** mean / **98.755 %** same-top-p PASS (identical to the r35 recorded base);
* GSQ IQ3_XXS + shared Q8_0 MTP, 2 GPUs, `--n-cpu-moe 48`, `-n 2000` `--spec-draft-n-max 3` greedy:
  generated text sha `2b2341670f23` (6320 chars), identical to r35.
* Server coherence through the new in-place prefill path: 2.9k and 61k greedy shas identical to r35
  (3 reps each); PR #119 same-seed greedy identical on the dense hc path.

### Note on PR #121 and the host pool

The in-place path reads the full pinned host master, which r35 always keeps (Phase 3 master-removal was
withdrawn), so this is correct.  It does mean `--host-experts pool` is bypassed for in-place tables: the
pool's disk-cache benefit does not apply to a prefill served in place.  Worth a follow-up if the pool ever
becomes the default.

## 2026-10-08 (r35) -- the bounded pinned host-expert pool (`--host-experts pool`); block 06

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r35`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip
**`645fd4989e542d93`**, net tree **`b2ba2bb32c76e857399be224ba8e303db172c8f7`** (strict **16/16**
`git am`, `validate-set.sh` green).  Block count stays **16**: the `archive/work/host-expert-dio-cache` campaign is
folded into **block 06** (the MoE expert cache / `--host-experts` block), plus the `mul_mat_vec_q_moe`
row-tail clamp into **block 13**.  The folded tree is bit-identical to the campaign tip (`b2ba2bb32`), so
the code was not re-validated from scratch -- the campaign's gate matrix is the release's.

### Why

`-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` host experts are backed by a full pinned (`ROCm_Host`) master.  For systems that cannot
hold the weights resident, the campaign adds a **bounded, optional** pinned host pool as a bounce buffer
over the page cache: `--host-experts pool` (a new member of `pinned|auto`; `mmap` is gone) sizes it to
`MOE_HOST_POOL_MIB`, default `MOE_HOST_POOL_FRAC` (25) % of the MoE host expert bytes
(`moe_host_expert_bytes`, the preflight estimate, so qwen4exp's PLE is excluded).  The pool is an
**option**: the default stays `pinned` (no pool), so the common fully-resident behaviour is unchanged.

### What landed (block 06)

* host-source registry (`moe_cache_set_host_source`, keyed by the host tensor) + `llama_file::path()` so
  the pool can reopen the GGUF after the loader is gone;
* the bounded, pinned, page-cache-filled pool (per host tensor, process-wide budget, LRU, per-`(slot,
  device)` in-flight events, one-shot prewarm);
* a **pool-aware device admission policy**: pooled tables run the device policy, and the in-kernel fill
  sources the pool when the expert is resident (`MOE_HOST_POOL_POLICY`), falling back to the master;
* the prefill-tally seed + pool rerank, a low-priority background eviction prefetch
  (`MOE_HOST_POOL_BGFETCH`), and the `MOE_HOST_POOL_*` tuning/disable knobs;
* the parked-bug fix: `ggml_cuda_vmm_map_phys` grants `cuMemSetAccess` to every peer device (a
  cross-device `hipMemcpyPeerAsync` into the slab work region faulted `Page not present`);
* the `mul_mat_vec_q_moe` row-tail clamp (**block 13**): the last row-block no longer reads dead rows past
  the expert into the next expert / off the tensor (a cold read sources the pinned master in place).

### Validation

`validate-set.sh` green (fresh-tarball strict 16/16 apply, applied tree == `release.json`).  3x R9700
(gfx1201), 35B-A3B Q4_K_M `-sm layer` and `-sm tensor` `-ncmoe 40`: short `359ff4337837`, long-prefill
`12d4fcd10886` (both `pinned` and `--host-experts pool`); dense 4B `1c5d32ac537d`; `MUL_MAT_ID` 931/931;
prefill-logit KLD **0.000707** / **98.755 %** PASS.  Long-prompt (`-n 3000`) default stays ~44.7 t/s
pool-off and 43.9 with the 25 % auto pool; the routing prefill is default-**off**
(`MOE_HOST_POOL_PREFETCH=1` opts in) because a sweep showed it hurts until the pool nears full residency.

### Env

`--host-experts pool`; `MOE_HOST_POOL_MIB` (unset/`auto` = 25 %), `MOE_HOST_POOL_FRAC`,
`MOE_HOST_POOL_POLICY`, `MOE_HOST_POOL_PREFETCH`, `MOE_HOST_POOL_PREWARM`, `MOE_HOST_POOL_BGFETCH`,
`MOE_HOST_POOL_DIO`.  See `ENVIRONMENT.md`.

## 2026-10-08 (r34) -- block 12's NCCL init is deferred to the first large tensor (`-sm tensor` decode 3x)

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r34`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip **`40ce2ab86`**,
net tree **`a253691093acbd965f0cb8978a19c03997ba3bfb`** (strict **16/16** `git am`, `validate-set.sh`
green).  Block count stays **16**: the fix is folded into **block 12**, which owns the hybrid all-reduce.

### Why

`-sm tensor` MoE decode was far slower than `-sm layer` -- and slower than a single GPU -- even though
single-GPU `-sm tensor` and `-sm layer` are identical (81.6 vs 81.4 t/s).  The delta is the per-layer
cross-device reduction of the split expert partials.  The default hybrid all-reduce already routed every
decode-sized tensor to the internal pipeline (a temporary dispatch probe showed hybrid and
`GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=internal` take the identical branch: every reduce `small`, `large=0`), but
`ggml_backend_cuda_comm_init_hybrid` called `ncclCommInitAll` eagerly, and **NCCL's presence alone
degraded the internal pipeline ~3x**.  Measured 3x R9700 (gfx1201), 35B-A3B Q4_K_M, `-sm tensor -ncmoe 0`:
hybrid 21.6 / nccl 21.7 / `ce` 45.9 (2 GPU) / internal 66.8-69.6 t/s.

### What landed

`init_hybrid` brings up only the internal pipeline and defers NCCL to the first tensor too large for it
(a prefill), via `nccl_lazy`/`nccl_tried` on the comm context; `init_ce` clears the flag.  A decode-only
run never pays the eager cost; a prefill still gets NCCL for the bandwidth-bound large tensors.

### Validation

`validate-set.sh` green (fresh-tarball strict 16/16 apply, applied tree == `release.json`).  GPU matrix on
3x R9700 / gfx1201 (ROCm 7.14):

* `-sm tensor` and `-sm layer` same-seed `359ff4337837`; long-prefill (prose prompt) `-sm tensor` ==
  `-sm layer` == `12d4fcd10886`;
* dense `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` `-sm tensor` same-seed `1c5d32ac537d`;
* `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` ROCm0 931/931;
* prefill-logit KLD **0.000707** mean / **98.755 %** same-top-p, PASS;
* `-sm tensor -ncmoe 0` decode **69.5 t/s** (was 21.6), `-ncmoe 40` 22.0 (was 12.7); prefill unchanged.

Output is bit-identical: the decode band's reduce path was already the internal pipeline, so only the
eager NCCL initialisation is removed.

## 2026-10-08 (r33) -- the pageable host-expert master is removed (issue #116); `--host-experts mmap` dropped

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r33`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip
**`6e567349cfb237f9887a3a55c45cbff874909c2e`**, net tree
**`13479e6ae709ce53a29c67f24e2c9cb8b16a95f2`** (strict **16/16** `git am`, `validate-set.sh` green).
Block count stays **16**: the change is folded into **block 06**, which owns the loader's host-expert
buffer selection and the MoE expert cache.

### Why

`--host-experts mmap` (r28) backed the `-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` master with the pageable `CPU_Mapped` model
mapping.  A GPU without XNACK -- gfx1201 reports `XNACK enabled: NO` -- cannot read a pageable address
in a kernel: the read is a fatal "page not present" fault (issue #116).  Verified with a HIP probe:
`hipHostGetDevicePointer` succeeds for `hipHostMalloc` and fails (`hipErrorInvalidValue`) for mmap/
malloc; `hipPointerGetAttributes` reports `Host(1)` vs `Unregistered(0)`.  `mlock`/`mmap+mlock` only
prevent reclaim (they do not give the GPU a mapping), and `cudaHostRegister` would pin the pages.  The
pageable master is therefore unusable on RDNA and the option is removed.

### What landed

* `--host-experts mmap` / `0` and the legacy `LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS` are **removed**: `llama-cli` and
  `llama-bench` reject `mmap` with a message, and the loader always keeps `-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` experts in the
  device's pinned `ROCm_Host` buffer.  `LLAMA_HOST_EXPERTS_MODE_MMAP` is retained in the public enum for
  ABI compatibility but is a no-op (warn -> pinned).
* Safety rails in the expert cache (correct even if a pageable master ever reappears):
  `bind_host_dev_locked` sets the in-place alias only when `cudaHostGetDevicePointer` succeeds; the
  device gather declines a master with no device mapping; a partial-residency pageable axis-0
  `-sm tensor` table declines (its only fill is the pageable 2-D H2D that faults on ROCm 7.14).
* `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB` in `(0, 2048)` now hard-aborts; `0` still disables the cache.

### Validation

`validate-set.sh` green (fresh-tarball strict apply, applied tree == `release.json`) and the full GPU
matrix on the 3x R9700 / gfx1201 box (ROCm 7.14):

* dense `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` `-sm tensor` same-seed `1c5d32ac537d`, == the r24-r32 golden;
* `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` ROCm0 OK;
* prefill-logit KLD **0.000707** mean / **98.755 %** same-top-p, PASS against the r32-recorded base
  (Qwen3.8-27B Q8_0, ctx 512, 40 chunks);
* Protocol A MTP (35B-A3B Q4_K_M, `-sm tensor -ncmoe 40 --host-experts pinned`, prose prompt
  `fabdec65...`, `-n 2000`, reasoning off, bf16 KV): `none` 87.9 -> `draft-mtp` **147.6 t/s**, draft
  acceptance **0.754** (1386/1837, mean len 3.26);
* band gate `llama-batched-bench -npp 16 -ntg 32 -npl 1,4,8,16` (q8_0 KV): B=16 S_TG **711.95 t/s**
  (r32: 705.7; all-VRAM ~720);
* smoke: `--host-experts mmap` errors in `llama-cli`/`llama-bench`, `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=1024` aborts
  and `0`/unset work.

### Follow-on

The bounded, pinned, DIO-filled host tier that replaces the reclaimable-page-cache idea is opened as
`archive/work/host-expert-dio-cache/`.  **Known separate bug:** `--host-experts pinned` + `-sm tensor` + a partial
arena still faults (1024 and 2048 MiB/device) at a host address with no pageable warning -- a host
over-read, parked in that campaign.

## 2026-10-08 (r32) -- issue #48 and #49 fixed: the multi-sequence reserve abort and the MTP stack overflow

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r32`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip
**`6a443a1b50f29e321ecae05997faa046b88705ab`**, net tree
**`8798d38b8e2c649d5aacba3a84d1dd108fe31526`** (strict **16/16** `git am`, `validate-set.sh` green).
Block count stays **16**: #48 is folded into **block 06**, #49 into **block 15**.  Both bugs were found
during the PR #115 (r31) review and recorded then as `TODO #48`/`#49`; both reproduced on the r31 build
with no PR-#115 code.

### #48 -- `llama-batched-bench -npl 4` aborted during the post-prefill re-reserve

**Symptom:** `llama-batched-bench -npl 4` (as the first row) aborted in `ggml_reshape_3d`
(`ggml_nelements(a) == ne0*ne1*ne2`) from `build_qkvz` (inlined into `build_layer_attn_linear`); a
`-npl 1` row first made the later B=4/8/16 rows run.

**Root cause:** the TODO #42 drop path (`llama_context::process_ubatch`) re-reserves the post-prefill
layout with a hard-coded `n_seqs = 1`.  The `mctx` it is handed is the **current ubatch's** memory
context, so for a 4-sequence decode the KV cache reports `k->ne[3] = 4` while the reserved ubatch has a
single token.  `build_attn_mha` then sets `n_stream = k->ne[3] = 4` and views the query as
`q->ne[2]/n_stream = 1/4 = 0` tokens; flash attention returns a zero-token output and the downstream
reshape aborts.  (`ggml_flash_attn_ext` also asserts `q->ne[3] == k->ne[3]`, so a fixed `n_seqs = 1`
cannot work against a multi-sequence cache.)

**Fix (block 06):** the re-reserve uses the current ubatch's sequence count,
`graph_reserve(cparams.n_rs_batch, max(1, ubatch.n_seqs), ...)`, so the reserved graph and the cache
agree on the stream dim.  Single-sequence (MTP) reserves are unchanged.  Measured: `-npl 4,8,16` and
`-npl 1,4,8,16` no longer abort; the 16-token MoE batch is **705.7 t/s** (r31: 702.5) and B=4/B=8 are
unchanged within noise.

### #49 -- `--spec-type draft-mtp` at `n_max 3` segfaulted on qwen35moe

**Symptom:** `llama-cli` on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M, `-sm tensor -ncmoe 40`, bf16 KV, the prose
prompt, `--spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3 --spec-draft-n-start 3` (and the default adaptive
controller) dumped core after ~47 generated chars; `n_max` 7/8/12 ran.  GDB showed an unbounded
`ggml_backend_meta_get_split_state(stc, tensor, ...)` recursion (SIGSEGV on the thread stack).

**Root cause:** `ggml_backend_meta_buffer_init_tensor_impl` computes each tensor's meta split state by
recursing through `tensor->src`; a cache miss on a deep graph (qwen35moe's recurrent-state chain is over
**1200** nodes) descends the whole chain before any cache entry exists.  Each frame holds a returned
`ggml_backend_meta_split_state` (~2 KiB), so the ~1200 frames overflow the 8 MiB thread stack.  The
8-version split-state cache only helps *after* a node has been computed, so the first descent is
unbounded.

**Fix (block 15):** before the (single) cache lookup, the outermost call walks the **not-yet-cached**
ancestors on an explicit heap stack and computes them in post-order, so every recursive lookup in
`calculate_split_state` is a cache hit and the C++ recursion depth stays at one.  The walk is pruned at
cached nodes, cycle-safe and visits each node once; a fully cached lookup never enters it, so the
steady-state hit path is unchanged (a run of the dense 27B `none` case: **44.8 s** after vs **44.8 s**
before, and 5 minutes/run while an earlier always-on variant of the walk was in place).

**Behaviour preserved** (generated-text sha256, `scripts/extract-generated.py`, prose prompt, seed 42):
`--spec-type none` and `draft-mtp n-max 7` stay `92daa37ab115`; `n-max 8` stays `b1a0ddf528c7` and the
all-VRAM build stays bit-identical to it; `GGML_MOE_CACHE_MAX_TOK=8` still restores `6124e50891c5`.
`n_max 3` now runs and equals plain (`92daa37ab115`).

### Gates

`llama-batched-bench` B=16 **705.7 t/s** (all-VRAM 720.2); prefill-logit KLD **0.000707** / same-top-p
**98.755 %** (PASS); `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` OK on gfx1201; warning-free build (clean
recompilation of the changed TUs).

## 2026-10-08 (r31) -- PR #115 folded into block 06: the MoE expert-cache band follows the routed-expert MMVQ band

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r31`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip
**`93fae0f8c975d7a111e134243e209d9463be0643`**, net tree
**`4f259e104f24dea2cf578b4cdfe5edd3ad2cec25`** (strict **16/16** `git am`, `validate-set.sh` green).
Block count stays **16**: the change is folded into **block 06** (the owner of the MoE expert cache).
This release also carries the previously **untagged** r31 test-only gfx12-GDN-accuracy fix folded into
block 02 (the entry below); no separate r31 tag had been cut.

### What changed

PR #115 (`@briansp2020`) widens the expert-cache decode/verify band from a literal **8** tokens to the
**routed-expert MMVQ band** the arena is actually read through (`get_mmvq_mmid_max_batch`, **16** on
RDNA4).  With MTP each active stream verifies `n_max + 1` tokens per step, so 3+ concurrent streams at
`n_max 3` (12-16-token MoE batches) previously fell off the cache to the host path (ids readback +
full device sync + H2D copy of every used expert, arena unused).  The band now has a **single owner**:
a new `moe_cache_band` backend iface hook (CUDA reports its device's band, the Meta backend the
narrowest over its devices, a backend without the hook keeps 8), and the scheduler's four literal 8s
plus the Meta `moe_cache_update` ask the backend.  RDNA3 (where the 16-wide routed band is floored /
incorrect) and NVIDIA stay at 8 by construction.  `GGML_MOE_CACHE_MAX_TOK=8` restores the old band.
The same patch fixes a pre-existing admission-policy bug: `moe_cache_policy_kernel`'s fill list (64
entries) could mark an expert resident without staging its fill once full; the list is now 256 and
admission stops when full (the expert stays cold, served from the host alias).

### Validation (3x R9700, gfx1201, ROCm 7.14.1; warning-free build)

Model `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M` (qwen35moe + nextn MTP head, `-ncmoe 40` host experts, arena
37324 MiB at 100 % residency).

* **Rule 5 (`llama-batched-bench`, `-npp 16 -ntg 32 -npl 1,4,8,16 -b/-ub 2048 -c 16384 -ctk/-ctv q8_0`)**:
the 16-token MoE batch (B=16) went **123.7 -> 702.5 t/s** (5.7x; all-VRAM 720.2) while B=4/B=8 stayed
unchanged within noise, and `GGML_MOE_CACHE_MAX_TOK=8` reproduced the old band exactly (132.1).  The old
code comment warning that the >8 takeover cost `-npl 16` 137 -> 52 t/s predates the extended routed
MMVQ band; at the kernel's own width the takeover is the fast path.
* **Protocol A MTP** (prose prompt, seed 42, temp 0, bf16 KV, `--reasoning off`, `-n 400`): plain
(`none`) 81.6 -> 81.4 t/s (unchanged); `draft-mtp n-max 12 start 12` (13-token verify)
**33.9 -> 110.7 t/s** with acceptance essentially unchanged (0.331 vs 0.336).
* **Purity**: `none` and `draft-mtp n-max 7` generated text byte-identical patched/pre-patch (and
`none == draft-mtp`, sha `92daa37ab115`).  At `n-max 8` (9-token verify, the newly served width) the
patched cache text equals the **all-VRAM** build bit-for-bit (`b1a0ddf528c7`) and the kill-switch
restores the pre-patch text exactly (`6124e50891c5`).
* **Prefill-logit gate** (dense 27B Q8_0 base): mean KLD **0.000707** / same-top-p **98.755 %** (PASS).
* **Oracles**: `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` **931/931** on gfx1201.

### Findings (pre-existing, orthogonal -- not from PR #115)

Both reproduce identically on the r31-pending build and are recorded in `TODO.md`:

* `llama-batched-bench` with `-npl 4` as the **first** row aborts in `ggml_reshape_3d`
  (`build_layer_attn_linear`) on qwen35moe `-sm tensor -ncmoe 40`; with a B=1 row first, B=4/8/16 run.
* `llama-cli --spec-type draft-mtp` at `--spec-draft-n-max 3 --spec-draft-n-start 3` (and the default
  adaptive controller) segfaults on the same model/config; `n_max` 7/8/12 run normally.

Minor nits carried in the code (not blocking): `moe_cache_max_tok_dev` uses a benign racy lazy init and
an unvalidated `atoi`; `moe_cache_max_tok()` resolves the band for the *current* CUDA device while the
hook is per-device (inert on homogeneous rigs, which are all the delivery validates).

Campaign record: `archive/work/moe-cache-band16/` (the original PR README plus the box validation).

## 2026-10-08 (pending, no release) -- the gfx12-GDN-accuracy campaign closed; a test-only fix folded into block 02

**Campaign** `wip/gfx12-gdn-accuracy/` closed and archived to `archive/work/gfx12-gdn-accuracy/`.  The
premise (the gfx1201/RDNA4 bf16 chunked-GDN kernel is less accurate than the gfx11 one) was **refuted**:
equal op NMSE, identical layer-0 real-data error, a marginally tighter gfx12 WMMA, a bit-identical retile
to the gfx11 shape, and an fp16-operand variant that is **65x more accurate per op** (2e-7 vs 1.35e-5
NMSE) yet moves the model KLD only **1.5x**.  The residual gfx1201-vs-gfx11 KLD is model-level numerical
sensitivity (the same bf16 GDN kernel spans >100x in model KLD across Q8_0/F16 and arches, and the arch
ranking flips), not a GDN defect.  **No GDN kernel code changed.**

**Delivery change (folded into block 02, test-only):** `tests/test-backend-ops.cpp` --
`test_gated_delta_net_cache_fusion` gains the bf16-chunked `max_nmse_err()` override (it had none); the
bf16-eligible cache-fusion coverage is the chunked `K == 1` pair `(16,128,256,{2,1},K=1)` plus a
sequential `(16,128,8,1,K=2)`; and `test_gated_delta_net` gains the model's exact op shape
`(16,128,256,2,2)` / `(16,128,256,1,2)`.  The old long-prefill `K > 1` cache rows were dropped: a long
prefill writes only snapshot slot 0 (older slots are caller-owned and never read -- a long batch is never
rolled back into), so the test was asserting slots the kernel does not guarantee.  `GATED_DELTA_NET`
48/48 and `GATED_DELTA_NET_CACHE_FUSION` 8/8 on gfx1201/gfx1100/gfx1151 (bf16 and fp32).

**No release cut.**  The fork's `rdna-boosts` chain was rebased to fold the test change into block 02
(new tip `e484553bf`, tree `5d76690ce900e6e61637c684be04a98404de4e3f`); `patches/` and
`rdna-boosts-all.patch` were regenerated and `release.json` refreshed to keep `validate-set.sh` green
(it names the pending `v16-a55e952b8-r31`).  **No tag, GitHub release, docker image or fork-branch push
was made** -- the fix rides along with the next real release; the r30 tag/state is unchanged.

## 2026-10-08 (r30) -- issue #113 root-caused and fixed: the BF16/WMMA chunked GDN default is back ON

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r30`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip
**`998f7baf4c7306b64aad4b993643a0ee2b67e8fc`**, net tree
**`f832fb68a4ccb286191efd17fb91a093f36b13bf`** (strict **16/16** `git am`, `validate-set.sh` green).
Block count stays **16**: the fix is folded into **block 02**.

### Root cause

The r29 default-off was a workaround, not a precision limit.  The bf16 kernel's per-chunk KKT inverse
`A_sc` is laid out `[chunk][head][seq][row][col]`, but the chunk term used the **same stride** as the
sequence term:

```
chunk:  c  * BT*H*BT  = c  * H*BT^2
seq:    nq * BT*BT*H  = nq * H*BT^2
```

so slots `(c, nq)` and `(c+1, nq-1)` aliased whenever `n_seqs > 1 && n_chunks > 1`.  With `n_seqs == 1`
(`nq == 0`) there is no collision, which is why every op test and the single-sequence model path were
clean.  `llama-perplexity` batches with `n_seq = 4`, which is where the 0.03-0.62 KLD came from.

Two test blind spots let it through: the GDN op test generated gates in `[-20, -1e-4]`, so the state
decayed to zero within a few tokens and the recurrence never accumulated; and most GDN cases are
`n_seqs == 1`.

The investigation (precision options 1-5 all ruled out; the op-level vs model-level discrepancy; the
real-data invocation-by-invocation dump) is recorded in `wip/gdn-bf16-audit/`.

### Change (block 02)

- `gated_delta_net_chunked_bf16.cu` and `..._gfx11.cu`: multiply the `A_sc` chunk term by `n_seqs` in
  both the kkt store and the scan read (plus the `GDN_DBG_A` dump indexing).
- `tests/test-backend-ops.cpp`: the GDN gates are realistic (`-0.5 .. -1e-4`) so the state persists, and
  the bf16 NMSE gate is tightened `5e-2 -> 1e-4` (it is ~1.3e-5 with the fix, 2-4e-3 when broken).
- `gated_delta_net.cu`: `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED_BF16` is **default-on** again (`=0` opts out); comments in
  the `.cuh`, both bf16 kernels and the test updated.

### Validation

40 x 512 wikitext-2, default `n_seq = 4`, mean KLD / same-top-p against the fp32 chunked base:

| arch | model | bf16 (fixed) | fp32 |
|---|---|---|---|
| gfx1201 | 27B Q8_0 | 0.000707 / 98.8 % | 0.00054 / 98.8 % |
| gfx1100 | 27B Q4_K_M | 0.000052 / 99.7 % | (base) |
| gfx1151 | 27B Q8_0 | 0.000150 / 99.7 % | (base) |

`GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46 on all three (realistic gates, tight 1e-4, bf16).  Prefill bf16 vs fp32
(pp512/2048/4096): gfx1201 +7.7/+7.9/+7.5 %, gfx1100 +4.2/+4.4/+3.9 %, gfx1151 +5.1/+5.5/+4.5 %.

### Notes

- The prefill-logit gate caught this because it uses the default `n_seq = 4`; the methodology now says
  so explicitly.
- `wip/gdn-bf16-audit/` is resolved and moves to the archive.

## 2026-10-08 (r29) -- issue #113: the BF16/WMMA chunked GDN path is now opt-in (default OFF)

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r29`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip
**`1417dda11d170903da22af6f42ebc8b1ea066621`**, net tree
**`7061a481ee6da6ff6324b997e1702ca874b275a2`** (strict **16/16** `git am`, `validate-set.sh` green).
Block count stays **16**: the change is folded into **block 02**, which owns the chunked-GDN dispatch.

### Finding

Issue #113 (mrkucuk, gfx1100): the `S_v == 128` chunked GDN prefill diverges from the sequential kernel.
Reproduced on both RDNA families against a sequential-GDN base (wikitext-2, 40 x 512, `-fa on`,
`--kl-divergence`):

| arch | model | arm | mean KLD | same top p |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| gfx1201 | Qwen3.8-27B Q8_0 | bf16 (was default) | 0.0324 | 93.6 % |
| gfx1201 | Qwen3.8-27B Q8_0 | fp32 chunked | 0.00054 | 98.8 % |
| gfx1100 | Qwen3.8-27B Q4_K_M | bf16 (was default) | 0.6228 | 79.4 % |
| gfx1100 | Qwen3.8-27B Q4_K_M | fp32 chunked | 0.000037 | 99.7 % |

The bf16 path is lossy on **both** arches; the fp32 chunked kernel is clean.  The documented
"near-lossless" claim (PPL +0.056 % / KL 0.0036) predates the 2026-08-28 runtime-dispatch fix and was
measured while the bf16 dispatch was silently compiled out (i.e. it exercised the fp32 path).  It was
never re-checked once the bf16 kernel actually ran; the stale claim is retired here.

### Change

- `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED_BF16` default flipped **on -> off**: `want_bf16_c` now requires an explicit
  non-`0` value (`envb_c != nullptr && strcmp(envb_c, "0") != 0`).  Unset or `=0` takes the fp32
  chunked kernel; `=1` forces the WMMA kernel (the RDNA4 file on gfx12, the gfx11 port on RDNA3).
- `test-backend-ops` `test_gated_delta_net::max_nmse_err` now relaxes only when `=1`; the fp32 default
  is held to the tight gate.
- Comments in `gated_delta_net.cu`, `gated_delta_net_chunked.cuh`, both bf16 kernel files and the test
  updated, and the "near-lossless" wording is gone.

### Cost of the flip (27B, `llama-bench`, `-fa on`)

| arch | model | test | bf16 | fp32 chunked | sequential |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| gfx1201 | Q8_0 | pp512 | 1552.2 | 1439.6 | 1372.6 |
| gfx1201 | Q8_0 | pp4096 | 1521.3 | 1412.7 | 1351.6 |
| gfx1100 | Q4_K_M | pp2048 | 1310.1 | 1257.3 | 1205.2 |
| gfx1100 | Q4_K_M | pp4096 | 1290.3 | 1240.6 | 1190.0 |

The fp32 chunked kernel keeps +4.5 % (gfx1201) / +4.3 % (gfx1100) over sequential; the bf16 path was a
further +7.2 % / +4.0 %, which is not worth the quality loss.

### Gates

- `test-backend-ops -b ROCm0 -o GATED_DELTA_NET`: 46/46 in the default (fp32, tight gate) and `=1`
  (relaxed gate) configs.
- KL: the default now equals the fp32 arm (mean 0.000538 vs 0.000538); `=1` reproduces the bf16 arm
  (0.0319).
- 4B Q8_0 greedy smoke coherent.
- The **prefill-logit KLD gate** is now defined, automated (`scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh`) and
  mandatory before release: mean KLD <= 0.005, same-top-p >= 98 % against a recorded known-good base
  (`benchmarks/prefill-logit-methodology.md`).  `TODO.md` #48 is closed.

## 2026-10-08 (r28) -- `--host-experts` first-class flag folded into block 06

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r28`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip
**`2983f72c81601d14a62979a71457ed330f2ba477`**, net tree
**`ae5aa3e060c541183b29346c0219ba71ad59d4a3`** (strict **16/16** `git am`, `validate-set.sh` green on a
fresh tarball).  Block count stays **16**: the change is folded into **block 06**, which owns the loader's
host-buffer selection.

### What landed

The `-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` host-expert backing is now a first-class option instead of only an env knob:

| layer | addition |
|---|---|
| public API | `enum llama_host_experts_mode { AUTO=-1, PINNED=0, MMAP=1 }` and `llama_model_params.host_experts_mode` |
| loader | `llama_model_loader` takes the mode; `AUTO` keeps the legacy env (`LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS=0` -> mmap), `PINNED`/`MMAP` force the choice |
| common | `--host-experts <pinned\|mmap\|auto>` (`common_params.host_experts_mode`), with `set_env("LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS")` so the legacy `0`/`1` still work |
| llama-bench | the same flag as a sweepable field (`host_experts_mode` in the CSV/JSON output) |

Default is unchanged (**pinned**).  `--host-experts mmap` leaves the expert master in the pageable model
mapping (`CPU_Mapped`) instead of the device's pinned host buffer (`ROCm_Host`).

### Validation (gfx1201, 1x R9700, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M, `-ncmoe 40 -ngl 99 -fa 1 -t 8`)

~4k-token prose prompt, `-n 64`, expert cache on/off:

| config | prefill t/s | decode t/s | peak RSS | RssShmem | RssFile |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| pinned, cache auto | 398.8 | 87.5 | 40.7 GB | 19.0 GB | 21.8 GB |
| **mmap, cache auto** | 376.8 | 87.1 | **22.2 GB** | **0.36 GB** | 21.0 GB |
| pinned, cache off | 390.2 | 39.1 | 40.7 GB | 18.8 GB | 21.8 GB |
| **mmap, cache off** | 369.3 | 38.9 | **22.1 GB** | **0.36 GB** | 21.0 GB |

* Greedy text is byte-identical between pinned and mmap (with and without the cache).
* The mmap cost is ~5 % prefill and ~0.5 % decode (pageable H2D); it removes the ~18.6 GB non-swappable
  `ROCm_Host` allocation, leaving the model in reclaimable page cache.
* On a 192 GB host the model stays in page cache either way; a forced-reclaim cold run re-warmed at load
  (the loader uses `MAP_POPULATE`), so the USB4 3.5 GB/s backing store affects load wall-time, not
  steady-state tokens/s, unless the working set exceeds RAM.  `--host-experts` is therefore a
  memory-behaviour knob (reclaimable vs pinned), not a general throughput win.

`validate-set.sh` green; the net diff over the r27 tip is exactly the 10-file change (no dropped lines;
`fattn-mma-f16.cuh` byte-count unchanged at 2654).

## 2026-10-07 (r27) -- PR #114 folded into block 15: four bit-identical qwen4exp decode fusions

### What landed (PR #114, @briansp2020)

Four `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/` decode kernels/fusions for the qwen4exp (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next) graph, each
bit-identical to the path it replaces and each with a default-on runtime kill-switch:

| patch | what | switch |
|---|---|---|
| 0001 | BF16 `hc_mix` up/collapse scheduled for latency: each warp runs its block's rows back to back (next row's weights prefetched, no barrier between rows), then one barrier and all (row, token) collapses in parallel; the second butterfly is its closed form `((w0+w4)+w2)+(w1+w3)` (same XOR tree); 256 blocks | `GGML_HC_UP_V2=0` |
| 0002 | `HC_COMBINE` fused into the BF16 `HC_MIX` norm that reads it (the product kept out of an fma with `#pragma clang fp contract(off)`) | `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_HC_COMBINE_MIX=0` |
| 0003 | shared-expert gate `ffn_out = moe_out + ffn_shexp*sigmoid(gate)` as one kernel; the matcher allows the allocator's in-place `ADD` (`dst == x` or `dst == y`, same stride) and its own disjointness check replaces the generic fusion-range check | `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_SIGMOID_MUL_ADD=0` |
| 0004 | the `beta` sigmoid folded into the sequential `gated_delta_net` kernel (decode/verify band only), looking past up to 4 view/no-op nodes; the GDN -> cpy cache fusion is kept | `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GDN_BETA_SIGMOID=0` |

### Validation (gfx1201, 3x R9700, ROCm 7.14)

  (up to **+21 %** at nt 8).
* The contributor measured +3.2 % greedy / +5.2 % chat on 2x R9700 / ROCm 10.0; on this box/ROCm 7.14
  the reproduced end-to-end gain is **+2.4 %** (all-VRAM, 3 GPU).  The host-expert config (`--n-cpu-moe
  48`) showed no reliable win after warm-up (~+1.7 %; the first-load delta was an arena warm-up
  artifact), so the PR's larger host-expert number is not reproduced here.
* The PR's own "not measured": RDNA3 hardware and `-sm layer`.

### Why it is safe

Each fusion is bit-identical by construction (same arithmetic, same reduction order) and gated by a
default-on `=0` kill-switch per the default-on policy.  The `beta_sigmoid` path is only reachable for
`n_seqs == 1 && n_tokens <= 16`, which by block 02's `GDN_CHUNKED_MIN_TOKENS = max(K>16?K:16, n_rs_batch)`
>= 16 can never take the chunked kernels, so the sequential kernel's new sigmoid matches the skipped
`UNARY(sigmoid)`.  Campaign archived (with the contributor's original handover) at
`archive/work/rdna4-qwen4exp-decode-fusions/`.

### The runtime DPP kill switch was implemented and dropped

A device-side runtime gate (`GGML_CUDA_DPP_XOR=0`) was implemented as a per-TU `static __device__`
flag plus a per-TU setter kernel and a host registrar (HIP without relocatable device code gives
every TU its own `__device__` symbols).  It is **not shipped**: on this box it reproducibly wedged
the FA prefill at ~4096 tokens with MTP, with `GGML_CUDA_DPP_XOR` set to 1 or 0.  The gdb backtrace
shows the GPU stuck under `launch_fattn<256,32,2>` -> `fattn_stage_try_get` -> `hipFree` waiting on
a wedged queue.  A/B on the same tree: r25 and the plain PR #110 patch (and the build with
`-DGGML_HIP_NO_DPP_XOR`) all complete the 27B MTP gate; only the runtime-gate build hangs.  The
DPP butterfly itself is fine, so PR #110 ships with the build-time gate only.

### Issue #111

Not a delivery regression.  The current `--spec-type` help lists `draft-mtp-adaptive` in both
`llama-cli` and `llama-server`, and `docs/speculative.md` lists it; the reporter's r15 output is
exactly the unpatched upstream base list, i.e. that binary was built without block 01 (stale
image/tree).  The only real doc bug, `README.md` implying a `--draft-mtp-adaptive` flag, is fixed.

### PR #106 patch 0002 is NOT in the release

0002 (hash node/source `data` pointers into the graph-cache key) is a **performance regression on the
r22+ movable-boundary slab**, so it was dropped.  Measured on 3x R9700, local qwen4exp UD-IQ3_XXS + shared
Q8_0 MTP head, `-sm tensor -ub 2048`, `-n 2000`, `-t 8`:

| config | p-min 0.5 | p-min 0 |
|---|---|---|
| r24 | 47.1 t/s | 91.8 t/s |
| r25 (0002 dropped) | **51.8 t/s** | **94.9 t/s** |
| r25 + 0002 (A/B on the same binary) | 41.8 t/s | 88.2 t/s |

The data hash invalidates warm graphs whenever an allocation address varies between otherwise-identical
calls; on the slab that is routine, so the graph is recaptured.  Text and MTP acceptance are identical in
every arm (`sha=05748dff46cd`; acceptance 0.60377 at p-min 0, 0.70141 at p-min 0.5), so this is purely a
performance effect, not corruption.  0003 is neutral (41.9 with only `GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_MEM_GEN=0`).  The
drop is recorded in block 15's message; the contributor may re-cut 0002 against the slab.

### Validation (gfx1201, 3x R9700, ROCm 7.14)

* Clean build, the same 9 pre-existing warnings as r24 (none new); `validate-set.sh` strict 16/16.
* `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` `-sm tensor` same-seed: byte-identical to r24 (`1c5d32ac537d`).
* qwen4exp MTP `-n 3000`: byte-identical text to r24 (`ca7f10bef267`).
* MTP acceptance (server): identical to r24 at p-min 0 (0.60377 = 256/424) and p-min 0.5 (0.70141 = 249/355).
* `test-backend-ops -b ROCm0`: FLASH_ATTN_EXT 6358/6358; HC_MIX and FLASH_ATTN_QSA pass.
* Issue #105 item 1: the `quantize_q8_1` page fault does **not** reproduce on this box even with
  `GGML_CUDA_Q8_1_ARENA_FREE_OLD=1` (the old free) under heavy load, so its FAIL->PASS remains the
  reporter's evidence.
* Issue #103 was already resolved in r12 (block-06 cross-device event wait + `alias_find_checked`); the
  reporter's r11 -> r12 rerun is the verification, so the issue was closed and `TODO.md` #34 fell out of it.

## 2026-10-07 (docs) — TODO #44 closed: the expert weights are already split, not mirrored (no delivery change)

`TODO.md` #44 and its handoff `wip/expert-cache-split/` claimed that `-sm tensor --n-cpu-moe N` **mirrors**
the expert weights across the GPUs, so splitting them would double cache residency and halve the host copy.
The claim was inferred from the field log's **288 cache tables** — but the cache keys a table on
`(layer, role, device)` (`g_sem_to_id`), so a **split also yields 288 tables** and the count cannot
distinguish the layouts.  Measured the discriminator (`expert_bytes` vs `host_bytes`) instead:

* The 9-shard IQ4_NL qwen4exp GGUF's **full** expert set is exactly **64800.0 MiB**.  `alloc_all_locked`
  reports its denominator as `Σ_tables n_experts × expert_bytes` over all devices; the field log
  (`/tmp/s22-logs`) reads `arena 39424.2 MiB of 64800.0 MiB host experts (60.8 % residency)` with 288
  tables.  64800 is the **split** value; a mirrored cache would report 129600 and ~30 % residency.
* A transient `moe_cache_table` geometry dump (patch archived) on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4_K_M, 2× R9700,
  `-sm tensor -ncmoe 41`: every table is `expert_bytes = 0.500 × host_bytes` with a symmetric per-device
  `src_off` (axis 1, gate/up: 0 vs 294912; axis 0, down: 0 vs 176/210 with `host_pitch`); the sum is
  18662.0 MiB, exactly the run's own denominator.  `GGML_META_SPLIT_COPY=0` registers **zero** tables.
* The host master is one pinned buffer on one device's `ROCm_Host` buft (the meta device's host buft is
  null), so `model.moe_host_expert_bytes` is a **single** entry — no duplicated host copy to halve.

Consequence: no residency doubling and no host-copy halving is available; the **arena** is the binding
constraint.  No delivery code changed.  The stale `AGENTS.md` note ("a tensor split mirrors the expert
weights, so `-sm tensor -ncmoe` is inherently slower than `-sm layer`") is corrected to say the weights are
split and the gap is the upload/pruning machinery.  The campaign is archived at
`archive/work/expert-cache-split/` (README + the geometry diagnostic patch) with a redirect stub at
`wip/expert-cache-split/`; `TODO.md` #44 is CLOSED and the wip index no longer lists it.  Residual, **not**
part of this item: the field config's `--load-mode none` — now **CLOSED** as TODO #38 in the cleanup entry
below (the fault no longer reproduces on the current delivery and the warning is stale).

## 2026-10-07 (docs, 2) — TODO list cleanup: #42/#39/#38 and the two done parked items moved here

`TODO.md` is forward-looking again.  The closed/completed items below were removed from its Active and
Parked lists, each keeping its pointer to the dated record; item #44 (the mirrored-experts premise) is the
entry immediately above this one.  The header's release-by-release narrative was compressed (it duplicated
`WORKLOG.md`) and the stale `beta/qwen4exp/README.md` pointer was dropped.  One small forward-looking item
was added to `TODO.md` instead: remove the now-stale `--load-mode none` warning from block 06.

### Item 42 — `-ub` trades prefill against the cache arena (CLOSED 2026-10-07, r22)

2 GPU, `-sm tensor -ncmoe 48`, cache auto, 16k: `-ub 8192` gave the best prefill (1040-1080 t/s with
staging on) but only 41-45 t/s decode, because the wide layout permanently reserved a large compute buffer
(3810 MiB at `-ub 2048` -> 11339 MiB at `-ub 8192`) while the arena took `free - reserve`; `-ub 4096` gave
68.9-69.1 t/s decode at 711-735 t/s prefill.  The DoD was **both at once**.

* **Crash half — r19/r20.**  The `-ub 8192` cache-auto OOM was the compute buffer's grow-in-place realloc:
  `sched_reserve` sizes it from a *measure* graph ~216 MiB short of the runtime layout, and growing needs a
  contiguous block *bigger than the one just released*, so free VRAM elsewhere does not help (a flat arena
  headroom changed nothing — 512/1024/2048/4096 MiB swept).  Fixed by a **10 % compute-buffer slack**
  (`GGML_COMPUTE_BUFFER_MARGIN_PCT`, HIP-only, opt-in per buffer type via `get_compute_margin_pct`), a
  **fail-soft arena yield at the single allocation choke point** (`ggml_cuda_device_malloc`), the
  wholesale-fallback invariant in `moe_cache_take_over`, and a device sync before any arena release.
  3/3 cli aborts -> 3/3 clean; server concurrent prefills 7/7 clean, 0 full releases.
* **`llama-cli` half — r21.**  The wide-prefill layout is now dropped before the arena is sized,
  default-on for `llama-cli` (`common_params::drop_compute_buffers`); the DoD is met (`-ub 8192` cache-auto
  16k decode **78.7 t/s** / prefill **1683 t/s**, coherent, MTP acc 0.9245).
* **`llama-server` half — r22, the movable-boundary slab.**  One slab per device (`cuMemAddressReserve` +
  ONE `cuMemMap`), split by a movable boundary: work pool below, arena above.  Growing the work region is a
  boundary move inside the already-mapped slab (the lowest arena chunks change owner and their tables are
  evicted), so **HIP is never called at runtime** and the work region's base VA never moves.  This
  *replaces* the "chunk the compute buffer so the arena can yield" plan (nothing is ever unmapped, and the
  ROCm sub-range-`hipMemUnmap` limitation stops mattering).  The drop is now default-on for every tool.
  Measured (2 GPU, `-sm tensor -ncmoe 48`, cache auto, 16k): `-ub 8192` decode **78.3** / prefill **1707**
  t/s; MTP `-n 3000 --reasoning on` bit-identical to r21 (0.53519 = 1848/3453); server
  `wide1 -> short -> wide2` **0 aborts** with both wide responses coherent; 3-GPU 99.9 % expert residency;
  `llama-batched-bench -npl 1,4,8` identical to slab-off; dense text byte-identical slab-on vs slab-off.
  Field-validated on the real config (`-ub 6144 -c 204800`, 2 GPU, a 30k-token prompt after a 45k-token
  generation): 0 aborts, prefill 1445 t/s, decode back to 68-71 t/s, `moe_cache_evict_slab_range` took
  5670 + 6156 MiB and `moe_cache_rearm` restored the arena to **38854.7 MiB** (88 tables re-armed).
* **Open residuals (documented here, not tracked as TODO items).**  (1) The thin steady-state headroom is
  **by design** — `ggml_cuda_slab_extend` reclaims the reserve the model did not need;
  `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_HEADROOM_MIB` defaults to 4096.  The transient-into-slab fallbacks were implemented
  **twice and reverted** (they cannot make a thin headroom safe — hipBLASLt allocates behind the
  application — and their only remaining effect is corruption instead of a clean abort).  Do not disable
  hipBLASLt (measured: corrupt output).  (2) The unit-mapping / tail-prune path is parked (ROCm rejects a
  sub-range `hipMemUnmap`; the slab needs neither).  (3) `atexit(moe_cache_report)` never prints because the
  report opens with `if (!g_enabled) return;` and a real run releases the arena or disables the cache at
  some point — deliberately unfixed, it needs its own validation.  (4) `build-rocm-r16` is a stale r21
  reference build (rebuild before using it).  (5) The `--fit` interaction: a fit that starts with less free
  VRAM than expected iterates 7 rounds and can trip a pre-existing Meta-backend assert
  (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp:519`); reproduces on a rapid restart, a 15 s gap or `-fit off` removes it.

  `OPEN1-FINDINGS.md`).

### Item 39 — `-sm layer` + host experts routes every MoE op to GPU 0 (PROMOTED, r14)

Folded into delivery **block 06** in `v16-a55e952b8-r14` (r13 carried it as a separate block 16).  2 x R9700,
IQ4_NL, `-sm layer -ncmoe 48`, cache on: **10.3 -> 55.4 t/s** in a same-session A/B (`-sm layer` now beats
`-sm tensor` for the oversized 2-GPU case, 55.4 vs 45.4, and does not hit the `--load-mode none` fault).
The chain: `ggml_backend_cuda_host_buffer_type()` was a device-0 singleton (upstream); the `ctx_key`
comparator merges same-name bufts; and the scheduler's op-offload loop returns the *first* capable backend.
The fix is per-device host bufts (F1) + layer-device host-buft choice in `create_tensor` (F2) + comparator
device tiebreak (F3) + offload-loop device filter (F4).  Single-GPU unchanged (48.7 both before and after).
**Remaining, not a delivery item:** an `upstream/` copy (this is generic `-sm layer` + `-ncmoe` multi-GPU).
Record: `archive/work/layer-split-host-experts/`.

### Item 38 — host-resident expert load page fault under `--load-mode none` (CLOSED 2026-10-07)

Opened 2026-10-05.  The original RLIMIT/`ROCm_Host` hypothesis was already disproven in the r15 session
(`hipHostMalloc` succeeds at 93 GiB against this box's 80 GiB `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK`); the fault was an
`-sm tensor`-only GPU access to the *pageable* `CPU_REPACK` host master that the loader fell back to
because the Meta device has no host buft.  The r15 loader change pinned the master, but the record still
claimed **~1/8** residual faults on the WIP build.

**Re-tested 2026-10-07 on the r24 delivery — the fault no longer reproduces.**  Exact original repro
(2 x R9700, `--load-mode none -sm tensor -ncmoe 48`, `AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL=3`, cache off, `--lazy-mode off`,
IQ4_NL qwen4exp): **14/14 clean**.  The buffer layout is now the safe one the original record recommended:
the routed experts are pinned `ROCm_Host` (**64800.00 MiB**, exactly the expert set — well under the 80 GiB
memlock) while the 27.8 GiB PLE goes to a pageable `CPU` buffer that is **host-gathered and never
GPU-read** (it is not part of the split upload).  So only the device-access-critical experts are pinned, and
the whole-model 92.6 GiB pin (plus the pageable `CPU_REPACK` master) that the older hypotheses worried about
is gone.  The `common/common.cpp` warning (`--load-mode none with -sm tensor and host-resident experts ...
known to fault intermittently`) is therefore **stale** — its own comment still states the experts land in a
pageable buffer, which is no longer true.  Removing it became the small `TODO.md` item #45 below; the WIP
campaign is closed (its owning record is `archive/work/host-pinned-buffer-crash/`, whose loader/pinned-staging
halves shipped in r15).

### Parked items done

* **`--fit` for `-sm tensor` (DONE 2026-09-21, block-06 r12 amendment).**  From `beta/tensor-fit-fix/`
  (archived at `archive/work/tensor-fit-fix/`): per-device targets, proportional or honoured `-ts`,
  auto-`n_ctx`, and an `-ngl` binary search, with an explicit `-c` never overridden.  `--fit` is no longer
  a no-op under tensor split.  Still worth an `upstream/UPSTREAM-PR-*` candidate (the change is generic
  llama.cpp).  Record: `WORKLOG.md` 2026-09-21 (r12), `patches/README.md` block-06 amendment.
* **The `fattn-mma-f16` instance-set build cost (PARTLY DONE r6).**  Candidate (a) delivered:
  `generate_cu_files.py` emits one MMA TU per `(ncols1, ncols2, head size)`, head-512 first (clean
  `ggml-hip -j16` **323.4 -> 236.0 s, -27 %**).  Candidate (b) tried and **REJECTED**: a runtime KV-type
  dispatch made the build slower (236 -> 304 s), and `__noinline__` cut it to 136 s but cost a universal
  1.5-2.5 % prefill.  The loaders stay force-inlined; the build-speed answer is ccache.  Record:
  `archive/work/build-time-regression/`, `WORKLOG.md` 2026-09-18 (r6).

## 2026-10-07 (r24) -- the cache floor decides early, and the cache + arena subsystem moves into block 06

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r24`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip **`46701e3ff`**, net tree
**`1a580f937447949e27f4f822b19714c1c8ebb826`** (strict **16/16**, `validate-set.sh` green on a fresh tarball;
`apply-all.sh` on a fresh clone reproduces the same tree, 0 whitespace warnings).  Two things: a correctness
fix, and a repackaging that changes **no code at all** (proven by tree equality with the pre-repack tree).

### The fix: `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIN_MIB` corrupted a run instead of disabling the cache

Measured before: MTP acceptance **0.00874** (51/5838) and 7.5 t/s where the streaming path gives **0.91797**.
Root cause, found by instrumenting rather than guessing: `llama_model_moe_cache_preflight` -- the ONLY place
the early floor (`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIN_MIB` and `_MIN_RES_PCT`) is evaluated -- walked `model->devices`,
which under `-sm tensor` holds the scheduler's **META** device, while `model.moe_host_expert_bytes` is keyed
by the **REAL** device that owns the host-expert buffer.  Every lookup returned 0 bytes, so the hook was
never called and the whole preflight was dead in the flagship configuration (`-sm tensor` + host experts):
`MIN_RES_PCT` was silently ignored (99 % did nothing) and `MIN_MIB` was left to the late check in
`alloc_all_locked`.  A late `g_enabled = false` is not merely late: it flips the **global** fusion gate
after the tables are registered and graphs are planned against them, so the MTP draft and the target are
planned with different kernels -- coherent-looking text, near-zero draft acceptance.

* `llama-model.cpp`: the preflight walks `moe_host_expert_bytes` (real devices; the post-prefill drop
  already relies on those keys via `ggml_backend_dev_slab_work_size(kv.first)`).
* `common/common.cpp`: the preflight call moves **before** `llama_init_from_model`, so the decision precedes
  every graph and reflects the VRAM the WEIGHTS left free (called after the context it sees only the
  post-slab headroom, which would decline the cache on every default run).
* `moe-expert-cache.cu`: a late floor trip no longer disables anything -- it logs an ERROR naming both
  floors and continues with the small arena (correct, more host traffic).  The late check honours
  `_MIN_RES_PCT` too (it only looked at `_MIN_MIB`).

Verified: `MIN_MIB=100000` -> early WARN (`auto arena on device 0 would be 24320.0 MiB < floor 100000.0 MiB`)
then acceptance **0.91797 (1466/1597)**, byte-IDENTICAL to `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=0`; `_MIN_RES_PCT=99` ->
same (it was inert before); DEFAULT unchanged (arena 36584.8 MiB, acceptance 0.92448); `-sm layer` unaffected
(arena 38327.2 MiB); server wide1 -> short -> wide2 still 0 aborts with no preflight decline.

### The repack: the MoE expert cache + arena subsystem now lives in block 06

The subsystem was spread across three blocks -- the module was **created in block 13**, evolved through 14
and 15, and the r22-r24 slab work was amended into 15 on top.  It is structural llama.cpp work (a device
cache + a VMM arena allocator), independent of the RDNA kernel blocks, so it now lives in the
system-operations bucket (block 06) and blocks 07-15 were rebased onto it.

Method (scripts + the extracted diff are in `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/repack/`): cache/arena **hunks** were
filtered out of `git diff block06..T_final` and applied at block 06 **per file** (`git apply` is atomic: one
refused hunk rolls back everything); `mmvq.cu` was excluded because its 8 `moe_cache_*` refs are the
**RDNA-specific cold seam** and belong with block 13's kernel work (the module itself references no RDNA
symbols); block 09's `compute_headroom 16->128` shared a hunk with our `alloc_buffer_usage` split and was
line-filtered to keep block 09 non-empty; the three subsystem files land in block 06 in their **final** form;
blocks 07-14 were cherry-picked with a conflict policy (subsystem-owned files -> take ours, otherwise additive
keep-both); and the tip was built with `read-tree` from the target tree, so the acceptance test is exact.

| block | before | after | what moved |
|---|---|---|---|
| 06 | 172 files, +2851 | 184 files, **+10025** | the whole subsystem in |
| 07 | +25 | +25 | identical |
| 08 | +5310/-138 | +5051/-131 | -259 (cache-adjacent) |
| 09 | +6/-1 | **+6/-1** | identical (line-filter preserved it) |
| 10, 11, 12 | -- | **identical** | untouched |
| 13 | 29 files, +5933 | 20 files, +2110 | -3823 (the module's creation) |
| 14 | +7848 | +7622 | -226 |
| 15 | +13848 | +11043/-1252 | -2805 (the module's later evolution) |

**Churn audit** (lines a block adds that a later block removes, boilerplate-filtered): **589** vs the original
chain's own **526** (+0.15 % of 42769 insertions).  The residual is hunk-granular relocation plus genuine
history -- block 15 legitimately reworks block 14's code (226 vs 221 in the original) and 13->15 is identical
(78 vs 78).  Only block 06 touches the subsystem files now.

**Gates on the repacked build** (`llama-cli --version` = commit `46701e3ff`): DoD `-ub 8192` cache-auto 16k
acceptance **0.92448**, decode **75.5** / prefill **1681.9**, `////`=0; rule-0 `-n 3000 --reasoning on`
**0.53519 = 1848/3453** (bit-identical to r21-r23); server wide1 -> short -> wide2 **0 aborts**, evicted
9682+9542 MiB, re-armed 156 tables, arena restored to 35254.8 MiB, both wide responses coherent.

**Also in this session (docs):** the top-level `README.md` lost its dated release history (three duplicated
places, the biggest listing releases on the OLD `84e76d8a2` base) -- **1130 -> 481 lines**, history now only
in this file; the `0016`/`0017` table rows were removed (r16 shipped them, r17 folded them back); the
headers now name the current release with the right tip/tree; and the `mmb` fold note no longer tells
consumers to check out `84e76d8a2`.

## 2026-10-07 (r23) -- diagnostics hygiene found by the r22 field run

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r23`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip **`ef49781df`**, net tree
**`f652d71c81be9ddbdf4dfb216b4ba83b8fb532b6`** (strict **16/16**, `validate-set.sh` green).  Still 16 blocks,
all folded into **block 15** (amended in place, subject unchanged).  Net change vs r22: 4 files, +43/-13, no
behaviour change.

Four cosmetic/diagnostic fixes from the r22 field logs (`/tmp/s22-logs`), plus one finding:

1. **Six "first N hits" prints were unconditional** `fprintf(stderr, ...)` and landed in every server log:
   `mmb.cu` `MMB_TALL` (2122), `MMB_BLK16` (2137), `MMB_DOWN16` (2354), `MMB_GLU` (2457), `MMB_SHADOW`
   (2499) and `ggml-cuda.cu` `MMB_HC16` (8231).  All are now gated on the file's existing
   `GGML_CUDA_MMB_LOG`, via one new `mmb_dbg()` helper.  **Verified A/B** on an IQ4_NL 16k prefill (T=6144,
   the field's shape): **0 lines by default**, **83 lines with `GGML_CUDA_MMB_LOG=1`**, including
   `MMB_TALL(wide 384x64) dense M=320 K=10240 T=6144` -- the exact line the field log carried.
2. **`ggml_cuda_slab_extend` reported free VRAM read BEFORE the mapping**, overstating the steady state by
   exactly the bytes just mapped (it claimed "6.18 GiB left free" where the truth is the ~4.06 GiB
   headroom).  It now prints the post-mapping figure and names the knob: `4.03 GiB left free AFTER this
   mapping, which is GGML_CUDA_SLAB_HEADROOM_MIB -- not extra headroom`.
3. **`alias_find_checked` warned once and never surfaced the total**, so a one-off was indistinguishable
   from a runaway.  It now prints the running count on the first refusal and every 10000th.  Reproduced on
   a wide -> short -> wide server run: `ignoring a stale MoE-cache alias (table device 0 layer 5, op device 0
   layer 3); 1 refused so far`.
4. **The `Meta()` / CPU teardown "compute buffer size does not match expectation" warning is fixed, not
   explained away.**  `backend_buf_exp_size` is captured once in `sched_reserve()` for the WIDEST layout,
   while `~llama_context` compares it against the CURRENT buffer -- which the (now default) post-prefill drop
   legitimately narrows.  The drop now refreshes the expectation to the layout it re-reserved, and the check
   only WARNs when the current size EXCEEDS the expectation (a mid-run shrink is a DEBUG line).  Result: the
   field's two big mismatches (Meta 2048 vs 11776, CPU 0.52 vs 241.2 MiB) are gone and **the server teardown
   is silent**.

**New finding (recorded, deliberately NOT fixed): the `atexit(moe_cache_report)` summary never prints.**  It
is absent from the field server log and from every CLI run, because the report opens with `if (!g_enabled)
return;` and the arena is released (or the cache disabled) at some point in any real run.  Making it fire
would activate a shutdown path that has been dormant (it re-reads per-device policy counters over the
runtime's memory after the context is destroyed), so it is not a "nit" change -- if the summary is wanted,
it needs its own validation.  (Consequence: the alias count goes in the WARN, item 3 above, rather than in the
report.)

**Also corrected for the record:** in this CLI the generated text goes to **stderr**, so earlier "dense
slab-on vs slab-off byte-identical" checks that captured stdout only were comparing timings.  Re-run properly
(both streams, the `> prompt` .. `[ Prompt:` region): dense `The capital of France is` is **byte-identical**
slab-on vs slab-off (142 chars each).

**Gates:** DoD `-ub 8192` cache-auto 16k: prefill **1695.0 t/s** / decode **74.4 t/s**, MTP acceptance
**0.92448** -- bit-identical to r22; MTP rule-0 (`-n 3000 --reasoning on`) acceptance **0.53519 =
1848/3453**, bit-identical to r21/r22; server wide1 -> short -> wide2: **0 aborts**, all four responses
coherent (`////`=0 each), arena restored to 35254.8 MiB (159 tables re-armed); `////`=0 everywhere.

## 2026-10-07 (later, r22) -- r22 FIELD VALIDATION on the maintainer's real server config

**Same release** (`v16-a55e952b8-r22`, tip `562e06f81`, tree `c0927a3ea`); no code change -- this is the
validation record.  Logs: `/tmp/s22-logs`.  Config: 2 GPU `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1
GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=ce`, `-sm tensor --n-cpu-moe 48`, `-ub 6144 -b 6144 -c 204800 --no-kv-unified`,
`-ctk/-ctv q8_0`, `--fit off`, `--spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3`, IQ4_NL 9-shard qwen4exp
(n_embd 2560, 48 layers, 512 experts / 10 used).

**The earlier "observations" were from a build with no slab in it, and are now retired.**  The `ce_tmp2`
OOM crash and the "35-40 t/s as if the wide work pool was never relinquished" both came from `build-rocm`,
which was an **r21 build** (0 `ggml_cuda_slab` symbols); `build-rocm` was rebuilt from r22 for this test.
They were r21 behaviour: the crash is the plain VRAM exhaustion the slab addresses, and the slow decode is
r21's server keeping the wide compute layout (the drop was cli-only).

**Result: stable and fast on the config that used to crash.**

| what the log shows | number |
|---|---|
| slab per device at init | 19.94 GiB = work 8.25 + arena 11.69 (8.00 GiB reserve, 4.00 GiB VA spare) |
| `ggml_cuda_slab_extend` after the first prompt | +2.12 / +1.62 GiB -> 22.06 / 21.56 GiB (work **2.25** GiB + arena 19.81 / 19.31 GiB) |
| arena auto-sizing | 39424.2 MiB of 64800.0 MiB host experts (**60.8 %**), restored to **38854.7** MiB |
| 30k-token prefill at `-ub 6144` | **1242 -> 1534 t/s** (29592 tokens in 20.47 s), no abort |
| its boundary move | `moe_cache_evict_slab_range` evicted 5670.0 then 6156.0 MiB (39424 -> 27036 MiB) |
| the following drop | `moe_cache_rearm` re-armed **88** stood-down tables -> arena 38854.7 MiB |
| decode after the 30k prefill | 35 -> 59 -> **68-71 t/s** (r21 stayed at 35-40) |
| 45k-token generation | 68.4 t/s mean, MTP acceptance 0.6455, arena hit 0.9633 |
| the next generation | **70.9 t/s**, acceptance **0.95131**, arena hit 0.9545 |

0 aborts, no corruption, full-speed decode *after* a wide prefill, arena fully restored.  The `ce` allreduce
temps this path allocates (~90 MiB/device at `-ub 6144`: `need = n_dev*ceil(ne/n_dev)*2 B` x 3 buffers) fit
in the headroom comfortably.

**Three diagnostics found (cosmetic; recorded in `TODO.md` #42 item 4 for a decision):** five
**unconditional `fprintf(stderr, ...)` debug prints in `mmb.cu`** (2122/2137/2354/2457/2499, where the
file's convention is the `GGML_CUDA_MMB_LOG` gate); the **`ggml_cuda_slab_extend` message reporting free
VRAM measured before the mapping** (it says "6.18 GiB left free" where the steady state is the 4.06 GiB
headroom); and the **never-reported `g_alias_stale` count** (the guard fired once and refused the alias
correctly -- but nothing reports the total).  **Explained, not a bug:** the teardown `Meta()/CPU compute
buffer size does not match expectation` warning -- `backend_buf_exp_size` is captured once in
`sched_reserve()` and compared against the now-narrow post-drop buffer at teardown, so it is structural
whenever the layout changed.

**Next battle (maintainer):** under `-sm tensor -ncmoe` the expert weights are **mirrored** across the
GPUs rather than split -- tracked as `TODO.md` #44.

## 2026-10-07 (r22) -- the movable-boundary slab: ONE mapped slab per device, and the end of the TODO #42 crash

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r22`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip
`562e06f8197b...`, net tree `c0927a3ea887588564f7fa1b354d773871a20b6f` (strict **16/16**,
`validate-set.sh` green).  Still 16 blocks, all folded into **block 15** (the slab belongs with the campaign
memory work it supersedes; a later repackaging into block 06 needs no code change).  Net change vs r21:
12 files, `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/open2-ideaB-vmm-compute.diff`.

**The design.**  ONE slab per device: `cuMemAddressReserve` + exactly ONE `cuMemMap`, split by a movable
**boundary** -- the work pool (compute buffer) below it, the MoE expert-cache arena above.  Growing the work
region is a **boundary move inside the already-mapped slab** (the lowest arena chunks change owner and the
tables living there are evicted), so **HIP is not called at runtime** and the work region's base VA never
moves -- which is what lets a growing compute layout keep every tensor address.  It supersedes the
per-allocation VMM pool (`GGML_CUDA_COMPUTE_VMM` and every `use_vmm` branch, **removed**) and the old "free
the arena and retry a contiguous `cudaMalloc`" approach: nothing is ever unmapped, so the ROCm sub-range
`hipMemUnmap` limitation stops mattering entirely.

**The TODO #42 crash is gone.**  The server abort on a later wide prefill (`cudaMalloc failed` -> assert) was
why the wide-prefill drop was cli-only since r21.  The slab reclaims a wide layout with a boundary move, so
**the drop is now default-ON for every tool**, server included: `wide1 -> short -> wide2` at `-ub 8192` runs
with **0 aborts**, all responses coherent, and the arena is restored after the drop.  Measured server arena
15908.8 -> 38026.8 MiB (28.0 % -> 67.0 % residency, `-ub 8192`).

**Four bugs had to be fixed to get there** (all ours, not the design's): (1) the wholesale-fallback gate had
to become **per table** -- under the slab a partial cache is the NORMAL state, and the global gate collapsed
the decode to the host path (8 CPU cores busy, GPUs ~30 %, 7-21 t/s); (2) the arena's allocation unit had to
be the fine VMM **granularity** (2 MiB), not the 64 MiB boundary chunk (chunk-aligning each table wasted
~9 GiB over 288 tables and made most tables fail); (3) `work_live` had to be a **multiset of live views'
requested sizes**, not a bool -- with two compute buffers live (main + MTP draft) a release shrank the
boundary UNDER a live view and the arena re-took chunks in use (MTP acceptance 0.01047, `////` output);
(4) the arena had to be sized on a **decode-band pass** (it fired on the second prefill ubatch, before the
drop released the wide layout) and the compute reserve had to be **right-sized to the observed workload**
(a short prompt used to pin the widest reserve for the whole run).

**Gates.**  DoD at `-ub 8192` cache-auto 16k: decode **74.2 t/s** / prefill **1712.9 t/s** (>= 68.9 / >=
1040), coherent, MTP acceptance **0.92448**.  MTP rule-0 gate (`-n 3000 --reasoning on`) acceptance
**0.53519 = 1848/3453, bit-identical to r21**.  Server `wide1 -> short -> wide2` 0 aborts.  3-GPU coherent at
**99.9 %** expert residency.  `llama-batched-bench -npl 1,4,8` identical to slab-off; dense generated text
byte-identical slab-on vs slab-off.  `GGML_CUDA_SLAB=0` (the plain path) coherent.

**Measured cost.**  The slab's arena is smaller than the plain path's (which double-books the compute
buffer's space), so decode is ~3.6 % lower in the `--reasoning on` config (61.5 vs 63.8 t/s, same binary);
the drop + the right-sized reserve more than repay it (75.5 -> 78.3 t/s in the cli DoD, and a much larger
arena).

**Not shipped, and why** (detail: `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/OPEN2-VMM-HANDOVER.md`, "OPEN ITEMS"):

* the **transient-into-slab** fallbacks (let a workspace/draft-buffer transient evict arena tables and be
  served from the slab) were implemented and DO engage, but were **reverted**: they cannot make a thin
  headroom safe, because the ROCm BLAS stack (**hipBLASLt**) allocates its own Tensile code objects and
  workspace behind the application's back and that class cannot be redirected.  At headroom 2048 the run
  aborts inside hipBLASLt, and **disabling hipBLASLt is not a workaround** (with `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0`
  the output was CORRUPT at 2048 and a 16k request returned one token then EOS at 4096).  `-ub 4096 -c 163860`
  therefore keeps `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_HEADROOM_MIB=4096`; the fallbacks add margin only, never licence to run thin;
* **`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIN_MIB`'s auto floor carries the same late-`g_enabled` flaw** and corrupts instead of
  streaming (measured MTP acceptance 0.00342).  Defaults to 0, so it only fires when set explicitly --
  **pre-existing, not introduced here**, reported for a decision;
* the parked unit-mapping/tail-prune path, the `Meta()` teardown size warnings, and the **stale
  `build-rocm-r16`** reference build (reads 2x slow on `llama-batched-bench`) are all noted for follow-up.

**Docs.**  `ENVIRONMENT.md` gains a section on the slab (1.3) with the whole variable surface, the
hard-reserve warning and the do-not-disable-hipBLASLt finding; the obsolete "a server must not drop"
rationale is gone.

## 2026-10-06 (r21) — OPEN 1 safety subset: the arena slot-count fix, the layer-uniform re-size, and the cli-only drop

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r21`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip
`94c3eeb89b4530dad9850cb29ce28bf296075b5a`, net tree `2cc89dfbe981abe2d858887c28cb9e25550edf99`
(strict **16/16**, `validate-set.sh` green).  Still 16 blocks; all of it folds into block 15.  The net
change vs r20 is 8 files (`archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/open1-candidate.diff`).

**A silent-corruption bug in r20's arena retry.**  `alloc_table_locked`'s r19 slot-count retry shrank a
failed arena to the largest count that fit but left `t.slots` at the **requested** count, so the table
advertised more slots than its arena held and the decode band read past the allocation.  Reproduced by
over-filling the arena (drop on, extra reserve 0): `layer=47 blk.47.ffn_down_exps.weight: 340 slots
requested, only 152 fit` -> generation full of `////`, MTP acceptance 0.007, exit 139.  `t.slots` is now
the achieved count, and `g_arena_bytes` tracks it too.

**Layer-uniform allocation.**  Every consumer assumes gate/up/down of a layer expose the SAME slot count
(an expert resident for gate must be resident for up and down, or the shared remap names the wrong
expert).  `alloc_all_locked` now allocates each layer as a unit — largest expert slice first — and if a
table falls short, frees the layer and retries at the achieved minimum (monotone decreasing).  A small
`free_table_buffers_locked` releases every device/pinned buffer a table owns; a final non-uniform check
disables the cache rather than risk a role mismatch.  The over-filled case now degrades a single layer to
a uniform 3 slots and stays coherent (72.2 t/s) instead of corrupting.

**MTP draft cap default 512.**  `MTP_DRAFT_N_UBATCH` now defaults to `512` (`0` restores the target's
`-ub`).  The draft's encoder-injection buffer is sized for its `n_ubatch` chunk, so at the target's full
`-ub` it held ~1.6 GiB/device that the MoE arena could use.

**The wide-prefill drop is default ON for `llama-cli` only (option B).**  New
`common_params::drop_compute_buffers` (default false) -> `llama_context_params` -> `llama_cparams`;
`tools/cli/cli.cpp` sets it true and `llama-server` leaves it false.  `LLAMA_DROP_COMPUTE_BUFFERS`
overrides either way.  The drop's extra arena reserve now defaults to `0`
(`LLAMA_DROP_EXTRA_RESERVE_MIB=N` raises it); the compute-buffer margin covers the small post-drop
growth and the layer re-size absorbs arena fragmentation.

**Why a server must not drop (the OPEN 1 blocker).**  A later wide prefill needs a contiguous
~12.4-12.9 GB compute layout back, and the r20 fail-soft yield cannot produce one: measured on
`llama-server`, a second wide prefill stood down **all 288 tables (40892-39992 MiB freed)** and
`cudaMalloc(12409-12939 MiB)` on device 0 still failed (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp:1813` `GGML_ASSERT`),
with `-np 1`, `-np 4`, sequentially and concurrently, at extra reserve 0 and at the default.  `-ub 4096`
(~6.5 GB) reclaims fine, so the limit is one contiguous block, not the total freed.  Reserving the wide
layout out of the arena makes the server safe but costs more arena than not dropping (26.1 % vs 31.0 %).
The server fix is OPEN 2: chunk the compute buffer so a wide prefill can grow in chunk-sized units the
arena can yield.

**Validation (2 GPU, `-sm tensor -ncmoe 48`, cache auto, 16k, all coherent `////`=0).**

| config | arena | resid. | prefill | decode |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `llama-cli`, fully default | 40078 MiB | 70.6 % | 1683 t/s | **78.7 t/s** (MTP acc 0.9245) |
| `llama-cli` `LLAMA_DROP_COMPUTE_BUFFERS=0` | 18848 MiB | 33.2 % | 1711 t/s | — |
| over-filled (drop, reserve 0, extra 0) | 42129 MiB | 74.2 % | 1616 t/s | 72.2 t/s (1 layer -> 3 slots) |
| `llama-server`, default | 26110 MiB | 46.0 % | — | 0 aborts, all requests exit 0 |

**Open (not in this release).**  The `llama-server` half of the OPEN 1 DoD: a server needs the large
arena *and* a reclaimable wide prefill.  Record: `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/OPEN1-FINDINGS.md`.

## 2026-10-06 (r20) - TODO #42 fixed: a compute-buffer slack + a fail-soft arena yield

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r20`, same fork point `a55e952b8`; canonical block-15 tip
`82fdd5dac7d8926a41cf210751eb3edb5ae04f91`, net tree `079367db1fb0244e0922cae7ce8cb29d9ae8296e`
(strict **16/16**, `validate-set.sh` green).  Still 16 blocks; all of it folds into block 15.

**The bug that started TODO #42, reproduced and fixed.**  `llama-cli`, 2 GPU, `-sm tensor -ncmoe 48 -b 8192
-ub 8192`, cache auto:

```
/home/stew675/llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-backend-meta.cpp:1799: GGML_ASSERT(bufs.back() != nullptr) failed
ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_type_alloc_buffer: allocating 11765.52 MiB on device 0: cudaMalloc failed: out of memory
```

3/3 runs abort before the fix; 3/3 are clean after it.

**Root cause.**  `sched_reserve` sizes the compute buffer from a *measure* graph, but a runtime graph
carries a different live-tensor set (host-expert staging, MTP taps) and needs ~3.3 % more
(6564 -> 6780 MiB).  Growing it is a free-then-allocate-larger, so it needs a contiguous block **bigger
than the one just released** -- which fails once the leftover VRAM belongs to the MoE expert-cache
arena, and cannot be helped by free memory elsewhere.  Two further allocators (`ggml_cuda_pool_leg`, the
Q8_1 cache arena) could also be the one that ran when the arena held the last free VRAM, and a
*scheduling* bug turned the arena's partial release into a GPU VM fault (ROCr then `abort()`s, which is
why the previous session saw a "silent death" and could not find an assert).

**What changed (all in block 15):**
* `ggml-alloc.c`: pad each COMPUTE chunk by `GGML_COMPUTE_BUFFER_MARGIN_PCT` (default **10**, `0`
  disables).  Padding the *allocation* (not the layout) means the per-chunk realloc trigger
  (`new_chunk_size > cur_chunk_size`) does not fire for a growth inside the slack.  Not the same as a
  token slack: that adds tensors and moves the peak, this only enlarges the buffer beneath the layout.
  Opt-in per buffer type via a new appended iface member `get_compute_margin_pct`, set **only** by the
  RDNA/ROCm path (`#if defined(GGML_USE_HIP)`) and aggregated conservatively (min) by the meta buffer
  type, so CPU/Vulkan/SYCL/MUSA/CANN/NVIDIA allocation sizes are unchanged.  Cost on 2x R9700: 1275 MiB
  of arena residency, 63.8 % -> 61.5 %.
* `ggml-cuda.cu` / `common.cuh`: the fail-soft arena yield now lives in `ggml_cuda_device_malloc` (the
  choke point every device allocation can share), and the Q8_1 cache arena routes through it.  Fixes the
  `ROCM error: out of memory` in `ggml_cuda_pool_leg::alloc` and in `q8_1_cache_get`.
* `moe-expert-cache.cu`: `moe_cache_take_over` honours `!moe_cache_has_arena_locked()` (a non-locking core
  split out of `moe_cache_has_arena`) so a partially-failed cache really does fall back wholesale; and
  `moe_cache_sync_devices_locked()` runs before any arena release, because the fused MoE kernels hold the
  arena address in their launch parameters.

**Validation.**  cli repro 3/3 clean (kill-switch `GGML_COMPUTE_BUFFER_MARGIN_PCT=0` still aborts, i.e.
default-on *and* effective); server concurrent long+short prefills 7/7 `A=0 B=0 alive` with 22 partial
stand-downs, **0** full releases, 0 faults/OOMs and 0 reallocations; arena hit rate 0.9651 -> 0.9741;
dense 3-GPU coherence gate clean (0 `////`).

**Follow-up (not in the delivery).**  `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/FOLLOWUP-compute-arena-chunking.md`: the
compute buffer is *already* a chunked virtual buffer (`GGML_VBUFFER_MAX_CHUNKS = 16`) but the CUDA buffer

type reports `get_max_size = SIZE_MAX`, so it collapses to one ~11.8 GiB `cudaMalloc` -- uniform chunk
sizes would make arena and compute units interchangeable.  And HIP VMM is off by default
(`GGML_HIP_NO_VMM=ON`); the existing VMM pool cannot serve as a general allocator (its `free` never
unmaps and asserts LIFO), but a VMM-backed buffer type would give chunked VA over non-contiguous
physical memory.  A cheap one-build probe is documented there.

## 2026-10-06 (r19) - MoE expert-cache arena safety: fail-soft release guard, slot-count retry, per-turn hit rate

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r19`, same fork point `a55e952b8` (base tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`); canonical block-15 tip
`659080b4c5ddb903eb31ea934cd7d033bbafd8a9`, net tree `24bea75dbf3f0e6c93e55f4dc9262192f270f955`
(strict **16/16** `git am` on a fresh tarball, `validate-set.sh` green).  Still **16 blocks**; the whole
change folds into **block 15** (the tip commit), so no later block is re-based.

**Why.**  TODO #42: a `llama-server` aborted on its second/concurrent prompt.  Root cause: the compute
buffer's *reserved* layout is ~216 MiB smaller than the runtime prefill graph's (a peak-tensor-set
layout difference, not a size one -- the peak is set by which tensors are live, incl. the 850 MB staged
expert table), and the MoE expert-cache arena -- sized from the leftover VRAM -- owns the space the
compute buffer then needs.  The growth is a **grow-in-place realloc** (`ggml_gallocr_reserve_n_impl`
frees the old buffer then allocates the new), so it needs a contiguous block *larger than the one it
just freed*: extra free VRAM elsewhere does not help, which is why an arena headroom (tested 512-4096
MiB) changed nothing, and why the failure was fragmentation-sensitive.

**What ships.**
* **Fail-soft arena release guard** (`moe_cache_release_arena`, called from
  `ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_type_alloc_buffer`): a failed compute `cudaMalloc` frees the whole arena
  once, warns, and retries.  The run survives with the expert cache disabled for the rest of the run
  instead of aborting.  Validated: two concurrent long+short prefills complete, **0 aborts**.
* **Arena slot-count retry** (`alloc_table_locked`): a failed slot allocation no longer drops the table
  to 0 slots.  It tries the requested count, then the exact largest count the free VRAM can hold
  (`cudaMemGetInfo`), then a 0.95 geometric descent (a failed `cudaMalloc` is cheap), keeping the
  largest count that allocates.
* **Per-turn arena hit rate** (server): logged next to the MTP acceptance line at the same level --
  `MoE arena = 0.9115 (727032 hit / 797580 reaches this turn), arena 36141.7 MiB`.  Plumbing:
  `moe_cache_get_stats` -> `ggml_backend_dev_moe_cache_stats` -> `llama_moe_cache_stats(model, ...)`; the
  slot snapshots the cumulatives and logs the delta (the counters are process-global, so with concurrent
  slots the delta is whole-process activity, a diagnostic not a per-session metric).
* **Opt-in, single-shot:** `LLAMA_DROP_COMPUTE_BUFFERS=1` drops the wide-prefill compute layout at the
  prefill -> decode transition and re-reserves the verify width, so a wide `-ub` and a large arena
  coexist (`-ub 8192` cache-auto decode 45.6 -> **75.5** t/s, arena 38686 MiB).  **Not server-safe** -- a
  later prompt needs the layout back and the arena owns the VRAM -- hence default-off.
* **Opt-in:** `MTP_DRAFT_N_UBATCH` caps the MTP draft's encoder-injection chunk (the draft is not
  decode-only: it consumes the encoder injection during the target's prefill, in `n_ubatch` chunks).

**Known open.**  The guard is a *full* release (the cache is lost for the run).  The partial shrink --
free the largest tables, retry -- is implemented (`moe_cache_shrink_step` +
`stand_down_table_locked`) but **unsafe**: standing a table down frees its arena while the scheduler has
already repointed the graph's `input_cpy` at it (`moe_cache_take_over`), so the in-flight graph dangles
and the process dies silently.  It needs an **un-redirect** first (restore `weight_cpy->data`), exactly
like the block-16 staging restore.  Handover: `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/HANDOVER-unredirect.md`.

## 2026-10-06 (r18) - the H2D staging width gate: the stale r7 table-size scaling is disabled

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r18`, same fork point `a55e952b8` (base tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`); canonical block-15 tip
`074e70259d71054dabb45a867e8411db511d0522`, net tree `1df33ad45fa5f8474269c590a6ead50369af12c3`
(strict **16/16** `git am` on a fresh tarball, `validate-set.sh` green).  **Only block 06 changes**
(`ggml/src/ggml-backend.cpp`); blocks 07-15 are re-based onto it (bodies unchanged, `From`/`index` lines
move).  The set is still **16 blocks** (`0000`-`0015`).

**Why.**  r7 added a table-size scaling to the whole-shard H2D staging width gate: the threshold
became `base * host_table_bytes / 144 MiB`, so a host table larger than the 144 MiB reference needed a
wider batch before the shard was staged.  It shipped in the *same change* as the ring auto-budget fix,
while the old fixed 2048 MiB budget was still disabling the ring mid-run -- so the `-ub 4096` data point
it was fitted to (450 MiB table: 1071 staged vs 1142 serial) was confounded (the "staged" run was
partly serial).  Re-validated on the same gfx1201 x4 box with the ring auto-budget, the pinned 2-D H2D
(item 2) and the per-pass gather guard (item 1) all in place.

**The change.**  `SCHED_STAGE_TABLE_REF_BYTES` default `144 MiB -> 0`: the gate is the width-only,
bandwidth-calibrated threshold (`GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MIN_TOKENS`, or the 14.5 GB/s -> 1542 default).
`GGML_SCHED_STAGE_TABLE_REF_MB=<MiB>` still restores the old scaling for A/B; `0` equals the default.

**Measured** (2 GPU, `-sm tensor -ncmoe 48`, cache off, 16k `/tmp/pl_16k.txt`, `-n 4`, `-t 8`, seed 42,
all `////`=0; device count asserted from the log):

| model / host table | `-ub` | staging off | forced (staged) | old default (scaled) | new default (width-only) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Flash-Next IQ4_XS, 850 MiB, `-sm tensor` | 2048 | 487.5 | 701.9 | 480.2 | **686.6** |
| " | 4096 | 729.0 | 1215.7 | ~729 | **1160.7** |
| " | 8192 | 997.0 | 1777.1 | 1540.7 | **1663.0** (32k **1911**) |
| Flash-Next IQ3_XXS, 450 MiB, `-sm layer` | 4096 | 748.2 | 999.4 | 757.1 | **977.8** |
| " | 2048 | 494.1 | 552.4 | ~494 | -- |

Staging beats the serial host path at **every** `-ub` from 1024 to 8192 on both table sizes (the only
non-win is a tie at 1024 for the 450 MiB table), so the scaling only ever turned a win into a loss.
The win grows at narrower widths (the serial path's per-split device-sync overhead dominates there):
IQ4_XS 2048 **+43 %**, 4096 **+59 %**, 8192 +8 %; IQ3_XXS 4096 **+29 %**.

**Gates.**  The generated text is **byte-identical** to the old default (only the load spinner
differs), 2 GPU, 16k.  3-GPU `-ub 8192` coherent (1564 t/s).  Dense 4B coherence gate coherent.  No
regression for tables <= 144 MiB (the scaling was already x1 there, so the r7 35B-A3B `-ub 8192`
config is unchanged).  The `-ncmoe 0` path is inert (the gate only fires for a host-resident weight).
WIP record: `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/ARENA-UB-TENSION.md` §11.4.

**Still open (stage-1 follow-up, not this release).**  The base width gate itself may be too high for
big tables: at `-ub 1024` staging also wins for the 850 MiB table (377.9 vs 299.8, +26 %) but the
calibrated base (1542) leaves it un-staged.  The crossover appears to *decrease* with table size -- the
opposite of the r7 scaling -- so a re-derivation (possibly an inverted scaling) needs the 144 MiB
reference re-measured at 1024/2048 first.  Then **stage 2** (the cache-auto `-ub 8192` OOM + the arena
shrink/reclaim).

## 2026-10-06 (r17) - the `-sm tensor` prefill staging win, and the block count back to 16

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r17`, same fork point `a55e952b8` (base tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`); canonical block-15 tip
`69dff839c473f0433616182d8a7d2bdf03a7ae13`, net tree `04764deb8322d77029060ff37d265d1dbc7a799f`
(strict **16/16** `git am` on a fresh tarball, `validate-set.sh` green).  `patches/` is back to
**16 blocks** (`0000`-`0015`): r16's blocks 16 + 17 and this release's two wins were folded into the
existing blocks (16 + 17 + the staging win -> block 15, the block that owns the current
`GGML_SCHED_STAGE` code; the cache win -> block 13).  Content unchanged, only the patch boundary moved.

**The win: a pinned 2-D H2D for the split staging slice, worth ~+50 % prefill.**  Under `-sm tensor` a
device's expert slice is strided in the pinned host weight.  `stage_gather` gathered it with a host
memcpy for the coarse `ffn_gate/up_exps` slice (one block per expert, 512 blocks) but, for the
fine-grained `ffn_down_exps` slice (1.31 M tiny blocks, over the 4096 host-gather bound), it H2D'd the
**whole 850 MB contiguous range** into scratch and compacted on device -- so the largest tensor saved
nothing and added a D2D.  `stage_gather` now takes a `src_pinned` flag (set in
`ggml_backend_meta_stage_input` when the input's buffer is a GPU host buft) and, for a pinned source,
copies the compacted slice with **one `cudaMemcpy2DAsync` H2D**, moving only `width x n_copies` bytes.
`GGML_STAGE_GATHER_SCRATCH=1` forces the old path.  Measured (2 GPU, `-sm tensor -ncmoe 48`, cache off,
`stage_d2d`, `-ub 8192`): 16k prefill **1774.8 t/s** (staging forced) / **1530.1 t/s** (default gate) vs
**1169.6** / **1038.9** before (+51 % / +47 %); 32k (4 ubatches) **1961.7** vs 1311.2; 3 GPU **1718.7**.
All coherent (`////`=0) and the generated text is **byte-identical** to the host/scratch and no-gather
paths; MTP acceptance `0.91797` (`-n 2000`).  It beats `-sm layer` (1409 t/s) and mirrored (1405 t/s) on
the same box, with the redirect still off.  The width-gate default leaves ~16 % on the table for a later
pass.  Full record: `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/ARENA-UB-TENSION.md` §§9-11.

**Also: the device gather's finite-head guard is re-armed on every gather** (`moe-expert-cache.cu`).  The
once-only zero (`archive/work/moe-mmq-overread/RESOLUTION.md` Hole B) does not survive a reused `input_cpy`; it
now runs per gather.  Free (1175.0 vs 1174.2 t/s), `GGML_MOE_GATHER_ONCE=1` restores the old arm.  Kept
defensively -- the r31 repro did not reproduce on this base/geometry.

## 2026-10-06 (r16) - blocks 16 + 17: the `-sm tensor` + host-expert `////` corruption family is root-caused and fixed

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r16`, same fork point `a55e952b8` (base tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`); canonical block-17 tip `c69086408`, net tree
`8b36016a25ca49921ec22e2f695b8fff95a92a34` (strict **18/18** `git am` on a fresh tarball,
`validate-set.sh` green).  Two new blocks: 16 = the op-offload staging redirect, 17 = the per-device
guard in the tensor-split input copy.  Full trail: `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/TENSOR-CORRUPTION.md` §§0-13;
candidate patch `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/source-guard-fix.patch`.

**The bug and the 10-day whack-a-mole.**  Under `-sm tensor -ncmoe`, the 3-GPU UD-IQ4_XS prefill
emitted `////` and MTP acceptance collapsed to 1.00.  Ten days of higher-level A/Bs (cache, staging,
ubatch, context, ncmoe, all-reduce, MMQ vs MMX, fusion) each ruled something out and then a new corner
case appeared.  The measurement that broke it open: an `[OVR]`/`[NANCHK]` reader-side dump showed the
first NaN is `blk.2.ffn_down` (q8_0) on **device 2 only**, with a clean activation and byte-correct
weights.  The pruned used-expert upload copies each contiguous run of experts plus a guard prefix, and
`ggml_backend_meta_buffer_set_tensor_async` distributed that prefix along the tensor-split axis.  A
chunk is a row range, so device 0 owns the first bytes: with `rem=512` the guard reached device 0
(272 B) and device 1 (240 B) and **device 2 none** -- its speculative MMQ K-tile tail then read
uninitialised memory and poisoned the tile.  That is why the empirical "fix" was a magic ~672 B (the
point at which the prefix first reached device 2) and why every prefix-shaped guard (run padding,
gather head pad, staging) surfaced a new case.  **The missing invariant: under tensor split, "the bytes
past an expert are finite" must hold per device; a contiguous prefix only covers device 0.**

**Block 17** (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp`, one line + comment): give every device its own
`min(rem, chunk_size_j)` guard bytes of that device's slice of the next chunk.  Safe because the chunks
partition the full chunk (`offset_j + chunk_size_j <= chunk_size_full`).  No kernel change; protects
all MMQ loaders equally.  A reader-side SRAM-lane clamp was built and also fixes it
(`mmid-reader-clamp.diff`, kept as an independent oracle) but is unnecessary once the guard is correct.

**Block 16** (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp`, `ggml-backend.cpp`): the same `-sm tensor` path's staging
consume repointed the device tensor at the ring slot, and `ggml_backend_meta_stage_guard` restored the
pointer right after enqueuing the child graphs; the kernels read `tensor->data` at execution, so the
staged bytes were never read.  Copy the slot into the real buffer (`stage_d2d`) instead -- equally fast
(the copy is free) -- and default the generic ring's `stage_mode` to 0.  A/B kill-switches:
`GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MODE=1`, `GGML_STAGE_META_REDIRECT=1`.

**Validation** (canonical build `~/llama.cpp` @ `release-r16`, gfx1201, `--temp 0 --seed 42`, staging
on): UD-IQ4_XS tensor 3-GPU `-ub 4096`/`8192` coherent; `-sm layer` 3-GPU, 2-GPU, UD-IQ3_XXS 3-GPU and
Qwen3.5-4B Q8_0 dense 3-GPU coherent; `-ncmoe 0` 3-GPU **byte-identical** (`ca51631f5eea`); MTP
acceptance `#mean acc len = 3.76` at `-n 2000` (code-python, reasoning off); prefill at `-ub 8192`/16k
**1030 t/s** (3 GPU) / **1094 t/s** (2 GPU) -- at least the coherent no-fix baselines, so the fix is
free.  The corrupt pre-fix build read 1831 t/s at the same point: the same "fast because it does less
work" artifact as the old 1572 t/s staging number, and the reason the first clamp A/B looked like a
3.5x regression.  MTP CPU-core observation: the 8 busy cores are the documented OpenMP active-wait spin
over the host-mapped input-embedding CPU split (`benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md`, 2026-09-24),
not CPU MTP compute; `OMP_WAIT_POLICY=PASSIVE KMP_BLOCKTIME=0` drops it 547% -> 331% CPU at identical
acceptance.

## 2026-10-06 (r15) - blocks 06 + 13: `-sm tensor` + host experts is no longer CPU-bound, and its cache is now fast

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r15`, same fork point `a55e952b8` (base tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`); canonical block-15 tip `7e2dcd8f1`, net tree
`0e9273f846c4b22d0db4297ba84312f158bab088` (strict **16/16** `git am` on a fresh tarball,
`validate-set.sh` green).  Both fixes are `git rebase -i` `fixup`s -- no content change beyond the diff.

**Finding: under `-sm tensor` every host-resident expert op ran on the CPU.**  r14's own per-device host
buffers (block 06) made `ggml_backend_cuda_host_buffer_type()` per device, which made the **Meta**
device's `get_host_buffer_type` return **null** (its simple devices' host bufts now differ).  So for a
`-sm tensor` layer (whose device is the Meta device) the loader's `-ncmoe` override fell through to
the pageable `CPU_REPACK` buffer (`.is_host == nullptr`), and the scheduler's op-offload device pin
(`src_buft_dev != device -> continue`) then skipped the Meta backend -- the expert op fell back to the
**CPU**.  `GGML_SCHED_DEBUG=2` confirmed it: `MUL_MAT_ID ... [ CPU ]` under `-sm tensor`,
`[ROCm0]` under `-sm layer`.  (Making the host bufts per device is what fixed `-sm layer` and
simultaneously broke the Meta host buft -- a genuine trade, and `-sm tensor` is the side that lost.)

**Block 06 gains the Meta-device host-buft fallback + the split-backend offload.**
`llama-model-loader.cpp`: when the layer device has no host buffer type, prefer a **real** device's
pinned host buft instead of `CPU_REPACK` (`LLAMA_TENSOR_HOST_BUFT=0` restores the old path; `is_host`
now holds, which is also what the cache preflight and the loader's byte accounting need).
`ggml-backend.cpp`: the offload loop accepts a Meta device that **contains** the weight's buffer device
(`meta_dev_contains`, via `ggml_backend_meta_dev_n_devs` / `_simple_dev`).  Expert ops now run on
`Meta(ROCm0,ROCm1)`.

**Block 13 gains the split-table device-policy skip, and the cache is now fast under `-sm tensor`.**
With the block-06 fix the cache engaged under `-sm tensor` (h=0.978) but appeared to make MTP *slower*
(20.3 vs 30.7 t/s at `-n 128`).  That was two things: a ~2-5 s one-time startup cost that dominates a
short run (sweeping the length shows the steady state is fine: n128 20.3 -> n256 31.3 -> n512 45.5), and
a real defect -- the **device-side admission policy and its prefill seed are tuned for a whole,
per-device expert**; on a Meta-split slice the Meta forward drives the policy per simple device and the
seed fills strided slices (`cudaMemcpy2DAsync`), which cost ~10 t/s.  `alloc_table_locked` now arms the
device policy only when `t.split_axis < 0` (`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_DEVPOLICY_SPLIT=1` restores it; split
tables keep the arena + slot remap and use the host promotion, and `-sm layer` / single-GPU are
untouched).  The load-path `set_tensor_2d` splice in `ggml-cuda.cu` also gathers through a pinned
staging buffer instead of a pageable-source 2-D H2D.

**Measured (gfx1201, 2 GPU IQ4_NL `-ncmoe 48`, MTP n3, `code-python`, `--load-mode auto`):**

3 GPU: `-sm tensor` **99.1** vs `-sm layer` 84.8 (r14 `-sm layer` 81.3).  `llama-batched-bench`

3-GPU Q4_K_M cache off == auto == `MIB=8192` = `49cadd794126ed66`.  Long MTP acceptance `-n 3000`:
3.76 mean, acc rate/pos (0.967, 0.922, 0.873) (cache off 3.74 / (0.963, 0.920, 0.861)).
`test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` green (ROCm0/ROCm1/CPU).  Coherence c32K/c128K `////`=0 with correct
output.  1 GPU IQ3_XXS `-sm layer -ncmoe 48` 48.4 (r14 48.6).  `-sm layer` and single-device unchanged.

**Open, not part of this release:** the `-sm tensor` + `-ncmoe` + `--load-mode none` GPU page fault
(TODO #38) still reproduces ~1/8 (the load-path pinned staging lowers the rate but is not the root
cause); use the default `--load-mode auto`/`mmap`.  The r15 session also disproved the original
RLIMIT/`ROCm_Host` hypothesis for it (a `hipHostMalloc` of 93 GiB succeeds against an 80 GiB `RLIMIT`).
See `archive/work/host-pinned-buffer-crash/`.

## 2026-10-05 (r14) - blocks 06 + 13: fold the per-device host buffers and the MoE-cache auto mode

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r14`, same fork point `a55e952b8` (base tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`); canonical block-15 tip
`0a130fa9f8ce415d0d850b64f1f78dfcc443d6ab`, net tree
`78238e337312805f0a4fff691a270d74cb03b5e5` (strict **16/16** `git am` on a fresh tarball,
`validate-set.sh` green).

**Structural change: r13's blocks 16 and 17 are folded into blocks 06 and 13** and the block count is
back to 16 (block 00 + blocks 01-15).  The **applied tree is byte-identical to r13** -- every fold was a
`git rebase -i` (`fixup`) that moved a diff into an earlier commit, not a content change.  Rationale: the
per-device host-buffer fix is a scheduler/host-buffer change and belongs in block 06 (the general
system-operations bucket, which already owns `ggml-backend.cpp` / `ggml-cuda.cu`), and the cache auto mode
belongs with the MoE expert cache in block 13 (the only block that creates `moe-expert-cache.cu`).  Two
conflicts in `src/llama-model-loader.cpp` were resolved to the final (post-r13) content: block 13's
`GGML_ASSERT(buft != nullptr)` with the new per-device accumulation appended, which block 14 then turns
into the `TENSOR_SKIP` `if` + the accumulation.

**Block 06 gains the per-device host buffers fix** (r13's block 16): `-sm layer` + host-resident experts
routed every expert op to device 0 because the CUDA host buft was a device-0 singleton, the loader's
`ctx_key` comparator merged same-name bufts, and the scheduler's op-offload loop returned the first
capable backend.  Per-device host bufts + a layer-device host-buft choice for `MUL_MAT_ID` weights + a
`ctx_key` device tiebreak + an op-offload-loop device filter.  gfx1201 2 x R9700 `-sm layer -ncmoe 48`
IQ4_NL **10.3 -> 58.6 t/s** (3 GPUs 81.0), single-device unchanged.

**Block 13 gains the MoE expert cache auto mode** (r13's block 17): `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB` **unset ==
auto** (each device sized from its own `free - MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_RESERVE_MIB`), `0` == off (kill switch),
`>0` == fixed.  A fully-resident model (`-ncmoe 0`) registers no table and is byte-identical to
cache-off; `moe_cache_ready()` returns true with no tables so CUDA-graph capture is not held off.  An
early `moe_cache_preflight` device iface (driven by `llama_model_moe_cache_preflight` from
`common_init_result` -- after the target context, before the MTP draft context) disables the cache when
the projected arena falls below `max(MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIN_MIB, MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIN_RES_PCT`=18 % of the
host experts`)` minus `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_AUX_RESERVE_MIB` (the measured ~3.7 GiB draft cost), fixing the
below-floor MTP trap (9.5 -> 34.7 t/s).  `--fit` reserves that floor in its per-device margin (host
expert bytes accumulated per device in the loader, so it works under `--fit`'s `no_alloc`) and the arena
then takes the remaining free VRAM.  Two WARNs state the reserved floor and the actual arena
size/residency (kept at WARN; llama-cli's upstream `LOG_LEVEL_ERROR` default does not show them, but
llama-server does).

**Measured auto:** 1 GPU IQ3_XXS `-ncmoe 48` MTP **48.6 t/s** (cache-off 32.6); 2 GPU IQ4_NL `-sm layer
-ncmoe 48` **57.8** @n=128 / **65.1** @n=3000 (cache-off 31.3); 2 GPU `-sm tensor -ncmoe 24` 46.0
(cache-off 45.3); 3 GPU `-sm layer` **81.3**.  **Gates:** `-ncmoe 0` byte-identity (3-GPU Q4_K_M, fully
resident, auto == off == `MIB=8192`); width purity `none == n1 == n3 == n7`; long MTP acceptance 0.685
(1 GPU) / 0.726 (2 GPU) at `-n 3000`; coherence c32K/c128K `////`=0; reserve grid (ctx x ub x MTP x
draft-offload, 8 configs) no OOM.

**Open, not part of this release:** the `-sm tensor` + `-ncmoe` + `--load-mode none` GPU page fault
(TODO #38) still reproduces 3/3; use `-sm layer` or the default `--load-mode auto`.  Campaign record:
`archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/`; upstream-PR candidate: `upstream/UPSTREAM-PR-per-device-host-buffers.*`.

## 2026-10-05 (r13) - block 16: per-device host buffers (`-sm layer` + `-ncmoe` distributes experts)

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r13`, same fork point `a55e952b8` (base tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`); new canonical block-16 tip

tarball).  **New block 16; blocks 00-15 bodies unchanged** (only the `[PATCH NN/15]` series header
became `[NN/16]`).

**The bug.**  With `-sm layer` and host-resident MoE experts (`-ncmoe`/`-cmoe`) on 2+ GPUs, every
expert op ran on device 0 while the other GPUs idled on the expert half (the delivery already noted
the symptom at r12; `COMMUNITY-CONFIG.md`'s "tensor beats layer at every offload level" was the
workaround).  Three upstream compositions cause it:

1. `ggml_backend_cuda_host_buffer_type()` is a device-0 singleton (`.device =
   ggml_backend_reg_dev_get(reg, 0)` for every device), so no per-device host buffer type exists;
2. `llama_model_loader`'s `ctx_key` comparator compares buffer types by **name**, and every host buft
   is named `ROCm_Host`, so distinct per-device host bufts collapse into one context and one buffer;
3. `ggml_backend_sched_backend_id_from_cur`'s op-offload loop returns the **first** backend that can
   offload a host weight -- always device 0.  The weight's buffer device is never consulted.

The loader also always selected the device-0 host buffer for `MUL_MAT_ID` CPU overrides.

**The fix (block 16, 4 files, +75/-21).**

* `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/ggml-cuda.cu`: `ggml_backend_cuda_host_buffer_type_dev(int device)` backed by a
  per-device table; `ggml_backend_cuda_device_get_host_buffer_type(dev)` returns
  `ctx->device`'s entry; the public `ggml_backend_cuda_host_buffer_type(void)` still returns device 0.
* `src/llama-model-loader.cpp`: for a `MUL_MAT_ID` weight overridden to a CPU buffer, prefer
  `ggml_backend_dev_host_buffer_type(layer device)` (`buft_list_layer->front().first`), falling back
  to the old `select_weight_buft(..., buft_list_cpu)`.
* `src/llama-model-loader.h`: the `ctx_key` comparator falls back to the device name when buft names
  are equal, so per-device host bufts get separate contexts/buffers.
* `ggml/src/ggml-backend.cpp`: the op-offload loop skips backends whose device differs from
  `ggml_backend_buft_get_device(src->buffer->buft)`.

(stash + rebuild), so the change is a no-op for one device.  Correctness: coherent (`////`=0), same-seed

## 2026-10-05 (r12) - blocks 06 + 13: cross-device split-input ordering and MoE-cache alias guard (issue #103, contributor PR #104, @briansp2020)

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r12`, same fork point `a55e952b8` (base tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`); new canonical block-15 tip

`1cd1d27e9467a1508f4b43eb98c18350055585bd` (`validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`).
**Blocks 06 and 13 change.**

Contributor [PR #104](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/pull/104) folds the two
fixes from issue [#103](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/issues/103) into the
owning blocks:

- **Block 06** (`ggml-backend.cpp`): a device-to-device split input is copied by
  `ggml_backend_cuda_cpy_tensor_async` on the SOURCE backend's stream, so the existing
  `wait_before_overwrite` (which only makes the destination stream wait) left it unordered against
  work already queued on the destination.  With `-sm layer` on 2 GPUs and host experts
  (`--n-cpu-moe` 29 and above) every MoE op of GPU 1's layers runs on GPU 0, so an outbound copy of
  split k's output is queued on GPU 0's stream after split k's event; when the allocator reuses
  that output's region for split k+1's input, the incoming copy on GPU 1's stream can overwrite it
  before it is read.  The fix records a fresh event on the destination backend right before such a
  copy and makes the source backend wait on it.
- **Block 13** (`moe-expert-cache.cu`): `moe_cache_tally_prefill` (alias fallback) and
  `moe_cache_get_table` (alias first) resolved `g_alias_to_id` without checking the table's device.
  Aliases are keyed by scheduler tensor addresses, which the allocator reuses across graphs, so on
  2 GPUs a lookup could return the other device's table and use its `prefill_count_dev`/arena from
  the wrong GPU: a page fault in `moe_cache_tally_kernel`.  `alias_find_checked` now trusts an alias
  only when the table is on the calling device and, when the op is known, in the op's layer;
  otherwise it falls through to the existing semantic lookup and warns once.

**Verification.**  The reporter's stock repro did not fire on this box: stock r11 was correct on
ROCm 7.14.1 and ROCm 10.0.0, with `llama-cli` and `llama-server`, `--n-cpu-moe` 29 and 48, `-t 8`
and `-t 16`, `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MODE=0`, `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_SLOTS=4`, `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=6144` and
both GPU pairs (the reporter's cards are on PCIe 5.0 x8 slots; this box reports x16, so the peer
copies are about twice as fast).  The race was reproduced with a scratch A/B knob that lifts block
06's `ne[2] > 8` prefill guard (`GGML_SCHED_REBALANCE_PREFILL=1`, harness kept at
`archive/work/2gpu-sched-fixes/prefill-rebalance-harness.patch`, never part of the delivery):
stock r11 + knob + events on gives `!!!!` (2/2 at 580 lines, 7.8-8.4 t/s generation), the same with
`GGML_SCHED_EVENTS=0` is correct, patch 0002 alone is correct, and patches 0001+0002 are correct
(3/3 at 580 lines, 23-25 t/s; 1/1 at 900 lines).  That is the reporter's symptom, their workaround
and the PR's fix in one place.  Patch 0001 is inert without `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB`; its page fault
was **not** reproduced here, so the guard is retained as correct-by-construction and needs a
reporter-side rerun.  Behavior preservation: same-seed greedy on Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0, 2 GPUs, `-sm
layer` and `-sm tensor`, stock r11 versus r11 + patches gives byte-identical generated text.
Record: `archive/work/2gpu-sched-fixes/VERIFICATION.md`.

Open follow-ups are in `TODO.md`: a same-family guard for the new cross-backend
`ggml_backend_event_wait`, a per-change kill-switch (neither patch has one), and the patch-0001
reporter rerun.

## 2026-10-04 (r11) - block 15: three RDNA4 verify-step fusions (contributor PR #102, @overdoingism)

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r11`, same fork point `a55e952b8` (tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`); new canonical block-15 tip
`ea86588646930c016d9caa49509154f31e338c56`, net tree
`38ebce2f738f9486a5fc1a95d26ca5a523bac902` (`validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`).
**Only block 15 changes.**

Contributor [PR #102](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/pull/102) (@overdoingism), the
revised [#100](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/pull/100), folds three default-on
verify-step fusions into block 15, each with a kill switch:

- **GLU -> Q8_1** (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GLU_Q8_1=0` off): a verify-band F32 GLU also writes the Q8_1
  activation the next mmvq matmul would quantize, into the existing quantize cache (same key and
  layout as `mmvq.cu`); the matmul then skips `quantize_q8_1`.  It reuses
  `unary_gated_q8_1_op_kernel` with an optional F32 output; the GLU/matmul pair is recorded in two
  `ggml_backend_cuda_context` fields, reset on every `ggml_cuda_try_fuse` call and consumed by the
  GLU launcher.
- **GDN conv at 2..255 tokens** (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GDN_CONV_VERIFY=0` off): `gdn_conv_check` accepts
  `T >= 2` on RDNA4, so a verify step's CONCAT is no longer a generic non-contiguous copy per layer.
- **Batched copy** (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH=0` off; RDNA4, not with concurrent streams):
  consecutive same-layout f32 `GGML_OP_CPY` nodes (the per-position GDN conv-state snapshots) go
  out as one launch after an independence check.

**Verification (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14).**  Applies cleanly at r10 (applied tree `38ebce2f`); clean
warning-free build.  The new `vf_sweep` geometry sweep ran **16,130 cases**: fusions on == fusions
off == stock r10, bit-identical, 0 failures.  rocprof confirms the fusions fire (cpy-batch 9,112;
`unary_gated_q8_1_op_kernel` 3,640 with `quantize_q8_1` down to 520; GDN conv direct 8,400).  The
end-to-end DFlash gate is byte-identical on == off == stock r10 (`55824e640aa0`).  Alternating A/B
(Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q4_K_XL + DFlash2, q8_0 KV, `-ub 512`, `-n 512`, WikiText-2 at 8.3K / 35.2K / 110.4K
tokens, same binary): every on run beat every off run, **+1.51 % (5/5)**, **+1.56 % (5/5)**,
**+1.31 % (3/3)**, generated text byte-identical.  Record:
`archive/work/rdna4-verify-fusions-lf/VERIFICATION-r10.md`.  One cosmetic follow-up was noted in
review and deferred rather than blocking r11: `gdn-conv.cu` and the new batched copy use two device
idioms (`TODO.md` item 32), which agree on every current graph.

## 2026-10-04 (docs) — TODO cleanup: closed and retired items moved to WORKLOG.md

`TODO.md` is now forward-looking only (active work, waiting items, accepted limitations, parked
ideas).  Everything that was closed, resolved or retired has moved here; the pointer to each dated
record is kept.  This replaces the former `TODO.md` "Closed" section and the closed items that were
still sitting in its Active list.

### Item 26 — `-sm tensor` mirrored MoE expert weights (CLOSED 2026-09-27)

**Opened 2026-09-27**, after the `-sm tensor` op-offload fix (item 24).  Under tensor split every device
receives the **whole** expert tensor (split state `MIRRORED`), so both devices compute the full MoE and
the upload is duplicated.  That is why `-sm tensor -ncmoe 99` (2742 t/s at pp8192/ub8192) stays behind
`-sm layer` (4111 t/s) even with the uploads overlapped.

**Root cause is identified (three parts):**

1. The scheduler's offload input copy is `ggml_dup_tensor_layout(src)` with `op == GGML_OP_NONE`, in a
   **COMPUTE** buffer, so the meta split-state machine takes its `GGML_OP_NONE` rule and returns
   `MIRRORED` (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp`, `calculate_split_state`).  llama.cpp's policy never sees it.
2. That is independent of the weights' own policy, which **does** ask for a real split:
   `llama_meta_device_get_split_state` (`src/llama-model.cpp`) returns axis **1** for
   `ffn_{up,gate}_exps.weight` and axis **0** for `ffn_down_exps.weight` (axis 0 of
   `[n_ff_exp, n_embd, n_expert]` is the **contraction** dim).
3. `handle_mul_mat` has no rule for a split weight against a mirrored activation in that shape class:
   `(axis1, MIRRORED)` maps to an axis-0 output, `(axis0, MIRRORED)` has **no branch and hits
   `GGML_ABORT`**.  A contraction-dim split also needs a `SPLIT_AXIS_PARTIAL` output plus a real
   all-reduce, not a plain split.

**So the work is:** seed the offload copy's split state from the weight it receives (the copy's name is
`<backend>#<src name>#<c>`, so the policy callback can be reached from the meta side), add the missing
`handle_mul_mat` `MUL_MAT_ID` rules for contraction-/expert-dim splits with the right `PARTIAL` + reduce
semantics, fix the per-device granularity to line up with the quantised block size and the expert
boundaries, and then validate — the split-state machine is `GGML_ASSERT`-heavy, so a wrong rule is an
abort or a **silent** wrong answer (it needs backend-ops coverage, same-seed coherence and a perplexity
ratio against the mirrored build).

**Payoff is plausible but must be measured, not assumed:** splitting halves each device's upload
(~144 MiB → ~72 MiB per device per expert tensor) but adds a cross-device reduction of the MoE output
per layer.  On the x4 link here upload dominates, so it should win; on a fast link it could be a wash.
A cheap first probe: make the policy answer for these copies and see where the split-state machine
stops — the first abort names the `handle_mul_mat` rule to write.

**CLOSED 2026-09-27** — the split expert weights under `-sm tensor` shipped as the prefill fast path in
delivery release **`v16-84e76d8a2-r16`**.  The campaign record (root cause, work list, measurements,
report + full sweep) is archived at
[`archive/work/tensor-split-expert-split/`](archive/work/tensor-split-expert-split/README.md).
Its decode half — and the loose ends it left (staged-upload pruning, the `GATHER_MODE` device heuristic,
the 3-GPU ub-8192 loss, the debug-knob cleanup) — now live in the new campaigning
[`archive/work/moe-expert-cache/`](archive/work/moe-expert-cache/README.md): hot-expert VRAM caching / UVA cold reads for
MoE **decode** under `-sm tensor`, iterating on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q8_0 and ending at Qwen3.8-Flash-Next.

### Former TODO.md "Closed" section

- **Tiled Gated Delta Net (TODO item 1) — RETIRED 2026-10-04; do not re-open.**  The scoping/port
  campaign was completed and measured on gfx1201 (Qwen3.8-27B Q6_K): pwilkin's tiled kernel is
  bit-exact, but this repo's chunked bf16/WMMA GDN (block 02) is ~5x faster at the op level and
  ~4 % faster end to end (pp2048 1028.62 vs 989.06 t/s, pp8192 953.51 vs 923.24 t/s), so adopting
  tiled would regress prefill for a ~0.02 % PPL gain over an already near-lossless path.  Maintainer
  decision: chunked GDN is significantly faster, so this work is retired permanently and will not be
  revisited.  Record: `archive/work/tiled-gdn/` (see its TL;DR verdict).

- **Item 2 (native FA staging for `q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1`/`iq4_nl`) — CLOSED 2026-09-15, promoted in
  the r4 block-15 amendment.**  All four native arms validated on gfx1201 + gfx1151 (`FLASH_ATTN_EXT`
  5951/5951; `native == staging` identical for all eight KV types; `W=1..8` one hash per type):
  +9-13 % decode on gfx1201, +22-27 % on gfx1151 for 0.6-1.1 % prefill.  Record:
  `archive/work/issue-30-mtp-decode-regression/MEASUREMENTS.md` I.
- **Item 22 (adaptive-MTP climb/drop retune, issue #35) — RESOLVED 2026-09-18 (rejected as not
  Pareto-safe); docs done 2026-09-21.**  A new 4-prompt-per-axis corpus showed the dense-Q4_K_XL
  winner loses Q8_0 prose on every configuration, so the base bucket constants stay; the only defect
  was a stale record pointer, since fixed.  Cap guidance: single card ~9, multi-GPU 6-7.  Record:
  `archive/work/mtp-journey-2026-09-17/SUMMARY.md`.
- **Item 23 (native bf16 prefill parity, the V5 penalty) — CLOSED 2026-09-18 as won't-fix in the
  loader; bf16 native was later made default-on in r6.**  The ~1-2 % prefill cost is the in-loader
  bf16 -> f16 conversion re-paid on every K/V tile re-read (no AMD multi-stage pipelining; kernel at
  the 256-VGPR ceiling).  Parity would need AMD loader pipelining or gfx950 packed-bf16 hardware.
  Record: `archive/work/bf16-native-prefill/README.md`.
- **Item 24 (H2D staging ring under `-sm tensor`) — RESOLVED 2026-09-27, promoted in r12 (block 06).**
  The ring symptom was real but the cause was the opposite: the meta device never declared
  `offload_op`, so `-sm tensor` executed the whole MoE on the CPU and there were no H2D uploads to
  overlap.  Three fixes landed: the meta `offload_op` capability, meta async arbitrary-byte-range
  sets/gets for mirrored tensors, and per-device staging.  Record:
  `archive/work/h2d-staging-ring/`.
- **Item 25 (`test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` fails at `m=64,n=16`) — CLOSED 2026-09-26 in r11
  (block 13).**  `mul_mat_vec_q_moe_launch` computed `rpb = 3` for `k == 3*qk` but only RPB 2/4/8
  are instantiated, so the launch fell to RPB 2 while the grid was sized for 3 and the last third of
  the rows was never computed; `rpb` is now snapped to a supported value.  Record: `WORKLOG.md`
  2026-09-26 (r11).

- **The `W=1` vs `W>=2` logits edge — investigated, documented, WON'T FIX (2026-09-15).**  A decode batch of
  one token and a batch of two or more can hash differently for the token-0 logits at some prefill
  lengths (on the 4B: q4_0 at P=224/256, q4_1 and bf16 at P=200; f16/q8_0/q5_0/q5_1/iq4_nl pure across the
  grid).  It is **logits-level only** — `argmax` identical in every observed case, delta 0.014-0.064
  logits against a top-2 margin of 2.2-2.7, one to two orders of magnitude below the error the coarse KV
  quantization itself imposes — and MTP acceptance is bit-identical across the arms.  It is pre-existing
  and independent of the native arms (`GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE=0` reproduces it byte-identically).  The
  launcher dump (`tools/fattn-launch-dump.patch`) proves the **KV split is already width-invariant**
  (`parallel_blocks=8` at every width; block 00's `ntiles_dst_eff` fix covers the band) and `ncols1=1`
  means there are no phantom query columns, so the earlier "whole `cols_per_block`" explanation is
  withdrawn; the leading (unproven) candidate is the per-tile mask-derived `i_sup` bound.  Not worth
  chasing: the fix would add work to the single-token decode for an unmeasurable reward, and it is the
  same recurring 0.5-9 % retrofit class as §19.  **Revisit only on an `argmax` change**; re-run the
  8-type x 5-length grid (~20 min) whenever a single-token-tuned kernel changes.  Detail:
  `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §36 + `archive/work/issue-30-mtp-decode-regression/MEASUREMENTS.md` §J.
- **Issue #30 wider-configuration umbrella — every action resolved (closed 2026-09-14; block-04 + block-15
  amendments, r3 + r4).**  Dossier `archive/work/issue-30-mtp-decode-regression/`.  What it cost: the arm-P
  reconciliation (the q8_0-KV depth fall-off, fixed by making block 15's V4 native staging the default for
  sub-F16 quants and adding the missing q4_0 arm); the adaptive-MTP `-c 196608` ceiling-12 load failure
  (the ~744 MiB F16 scratch the same policy removes); the deep-prefill regression (block 04: the head-256
  WMMA config was arch-blind and `ncols2` split-blind); the #28867 head-256 threshold (not a delivery
  regression -- the `Q->ne[1] > 8` guard already keeps the purity band on TILE); and the reporter's r3
  q4_0 NaN (the tile kernel is instantiated with one `type_KV` for both operands while the launcher chose
  its native read per tensor -- so a mixed pair staged nothing and read raw q4_0 as F16 -- plus the
  `get_alloc_size` TILE case that never learned about the q4_0 arm and kept reserving the scratch).
  Evidence: `MEASUREMENTS.md` sections A-H.

- **Q8_0 K/V prefill recovered (closed 2026-09-14; block-15 amendment, r4).**  The band split: a prefill
  (`n_q > 8`) stages -- the whole-prefix F16 conversion is amortised over the query rows and the tiles then
  feed the `cp_async` pipeline -- while decode/verify keeps the native read.  The staging scratch moved out
  of the compute-graph reserve (which sized it for `n_ctx`, ~800 MiB/GPU at 200k) into a per-context,
  per-stream arena, so the memory win stays.  It is arch-gated (`prefill_stages = !RDNA3_5`): gfx1201
  q8_0 pp150k **661.0 -> 691.4** (1 GPU), **996.0 -> 1076.9** (2-card), **1111.4 -> 1199.0** (3-card),
  while gfx1151 has no crossover and keeps its native prefill (it wins there at every depth: +0.4 % @16k
  growing to +1.6 % @65k).  Decode d65k stays 23.17, the reserve stays 123 MiB (gfx1201) / 89 MiB
  (gfx1151), and both arches are 5951/5951 with purity PURE.  Evidence: `MEASUREMENTS.md` sections F/H;
  diff `patches/2026-09-14-todo21-prefill-arena-staging.diff`.  **Follow-up (2026-09-15, r3, issue #33):**
  the arena sits outside the compute-graph reserve on purpose, so `--fit` does not count it; its growth
  now returns null on a failed `cudaMalloc` and the launcher falls back to the native read for that
  prefill (bit-identical, prefill-speed only) instead of aborting on a nearly-full card.

- **Issue #30 draft-depth policy: the `--spec-draft-n-max` clamp moved from 7 to 15, and the qwen4exp
  QSA decode-arm band now tracks the verify width (closed 2026-09-13, block-01 + block-14 amendments).**
  The park reason was a claimed **rewind corruption** above depth 7 on qwen4exp.  Investigation: (1) a
  new deterministic reference-context sweep (`tests/test-recurrent-state-depth`, `n_rs_seq` 1..15 ×
  every rollback × deep drafts) is green on qwen35/dsv4/kimi-k3/qwen4exp — **there is no rewind
  corruption in the allowed range**; (2) the qwen4exp depth-15 divergence past the 2051 selection width
  was the QSA dense decode arm (`QSA_DECODE_BAND = 8`) flipping to the sparse top-k arm for a 9..16-row
  verify, now `max(QSA_DECODE_BAND, cparams.n_rs_batch)`; (3) the residual purity loss above 7 is the
  documented kernel-family switch at 8 rows (FA tile/MMA **and** matmul MMVQ/MMVF -> MMQ), accepted
  with a visible notice.  The clamp is now 15 (recurrent snapshot bound) with a purity notice above 7;
  default `n_max 3` is unaffected.  New canonical tip `c45244c72`, tree `a5683e1b008e`; strict 16/16

- **Dense prefill regression from the 2026-09-13 re-base (closed 2026-09-13 (latest), block-14 amendment
  (ninth)).**  The re-base merged upstream's new `mmq_args::ncols_opt`, but block-14's
  `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q_pair` (a hand-built `mmq_args` in both arms) left it `0`, so the MMQ tile heuristic
  stopped at `J=8` — up to **2.2x slower dense prefill**, 14-48 % below the pre-rebase delivery, on every
  dense model (27B Q8_0/Q4_K_XL, 4B).  It was invisible on qwen4exp (its `MUL_MAT_ID` pair's correct `J`
  is already ~8) and the pair A/B had only ever been run there.  Fixed both arms (standalone semantics)
  plus a `ncols_max` fallback in the heuristic; pp4096: 27B Q8_0 623 -> **1363** / 1718 -> **2176**, 27B
  UD-Q4_K_XL 905 -> **1264** / 1693 -> **2040**, 4B 5386 -> **7304** (all >= pre-rebase and well above

- **MoE-router `topk_moe` fusion selection was address-dependent (TODO item 19, closed 2026-09-13, block-08
  amendment (seventh)).**  The fused router was **not** bit-identical to the generic
  `soft_max -> argsort -> get_rows -> norm` chain (different softmax reduction order, a reciprocal
  instead of `sum_rows`+`div`, and an unstable bitonic-argsort tie-break vs the fused iterative
  argmax's smaller-index rule), and the fusion is selected by an **address-overlap** guard — so moving
  the QSA indexer `get_rows` to the GPU flipped the coverage and the qwen4exp `iq4_nl` greedy text.  The
  fused kernel now reproduces the generic reduction orders and the bitonic argsort breaks ties by index
  (matching the CUB path and the fused router), so fused == unfused for every native KV type on both
  split modes; the `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_TOPK_MOE_FUSION=1` A/B kill-switch is kept.  `iq4_nl` tensor

  QSA indexer key cache tracks `type_k`, so an `iq4_nl` cache sent the 128-wide indexer `get_rows` to
  the CPU (`ne[0] % QK_K != 0`; the CUDA `GET_ROWS` predicate only wired the sub-block types to the
  `QK_K` super-block kernel), turning one node per indexer-bearing layer into a host round trip —
  **26 graph splits** per qwen4exp prefill graph, GPU busy/span 0.62 vs `q4_0`'s 0.96.  `getrows.cu`
  now has the `iq4_nl` sub-`QK_K` path and the predicate accepts `ne00 % QK4_NL == 0`; the gather is
  **bit-exact vs the CPU** at every width.  qwen4exp `iq4_nl` prefill pp8192 1815-1951 -> **2385-2422
  t/s** (= f16/`q4_0`), pp32768 **+36 %**, splits 142 -> 22, `GET_ROWS` 215/215 -> **219/219**.  The
  absolute `iq4_nl` text moved (`c0d44c479ee1` -> `14a1a3f257f4`) because the layout change flips the
  address-dependent MoE-router fusion (new item 19); the `W = 1..8` / `plain == n_max 3 == n_max 7`
  gates and the f16/`q4_0`/4B controls all hold.  Canonical tip `ab2fabb44`, tree
  `e279b222e8e98a7574814929d4b6d97edae32a48`; `WORKLOG.md` 2026-09-13 (later), `patches/README.md`

- **Block 15 promoted to the delivery (TODO item 1, closed 2026-09-12).**  The attention-memory campaign
  was promoted from `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/` to `patches/0015-rdna-boosts-block-15-campaign-memory-wins.patch`;
  the delivery is now a **16-patch set** (block 00 + blocks 01-15) with `scripts/apply-all.sh` /
  `make-patches.sh` as 16-block flows.  Canonical 16-block tip **`0f4f83f9ef01ffd1662f58d714d62b9155325a62`**,
  net tree **`c3142fe0b311757f458647f172f623859f5bc983`**; strict **16/16** `git am` on a fresh worktree at
  `9113cc188`, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree == the re-validated beta tree.  The promoted patch is
  byte-identical to the beta patch apart from its `From <sha>` line, and blocks `0000`-`0014` are
  byte-identical to the previous delivery apart from the `From` lines + the `[PATCH NN/14]` -> `[PATCH NN/15]`
  series denominator.  The seven wins keep their gates (V4/V5 behind `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE`, opt-in default
  0); the revalidation reproduced every reserve number to the last decimal and the width-probe reference
  hashes, with byte-identical coherence across gates and the MTP gate unchanged (`draft-mtp` acceptance must
  stay > ~0.45).  The W2-`iq4_nl` ULP caveat is accepted and recorded.  See `patches/README.md` (the
  block-15 promotion section), `WORKLOG.md` and `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/README.md` (PROMOTED).

- **QSA sparse-regime width purity (TODO item 4, closed 2026-09-12 (12); sub-item (b) re-opened and root-caused/fixed 2026-09-12 (13), block-14 amendment (eighth); gfx1151 cross-check validated 2026-09-12 (14)).**  Sub-item (a), the `embeddings_nextn` MTP-export last-layer gather deferral, is fixed — the last layer always gathers its output rows and builds a separate full-row tail for `t_h_nextn` — so the prefill logits are bit-identical to `--spec-type none` (`mstep NEXTN=1` 0 mismatches, was 1 at `pos = 4293`).  Sub-item (b) was a **width dependence** (the QSA indexer score's flattened `ne11 = 4 * n_tps` crossed `MMVF_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` at `n_tps = 3`, putting the verify batch on MMF while decode stayed on MMVF); the eighth amendment keeps the whole flattened band on the decode family, so `W = 1..8` is bit-identical with the W=1 `Thash` unchanged.  **gfx1151 cross-check (item 17, closed 2026-09-12 (14)):** the recorded forced-sparse `plain != draft-mtp` text residual is gone (`a57bc13bbf2a` both, was n3 `3124adfd2b94`; first diff char 458 pre-fix), all eight native KV types (f16/bf16/q8_0/q4_0/q4_1/q5_0/q5_1/iq4_nl) are pure at n_max 1/2/3/5/7, and the mstep `W = 1,2,3,4,5,8` matrix is 0 mismatches (only q8_0/q5_0 were ever impure pre-fix).  See `WORKLOG.md` 2026-09-12 (12)/(13)/(14) and `patches/README.md`.

**The GDN recurrent-state rollback bound (`n_rs_batch`) + the pre-batch snapshot slot (landed 2026-09-12 (10), block-02 amendment).**
Integrated from the gfx1201 investigation in `~/ngram-mod/` (record `archive/work/gdn-rs-rollback/`, originals
copied in).  The whole-batch chunked GDN kernel writes no rollback snapshots and assumed a batch above
`max(K, 16)` is never rolled back into — false when a long-draft speculator is enabled
(`n_rs_seq` comes from `speculative.draft.n_max` = 7 while `--spec-ngram-mod-n-max` can draft 64), so
a 65-token verify batch followed by a small tail rollback restored an unwritten plane and the
recurrent state silently rewound (the block-02 `seq_rm` guard is the detector — the reported warning
is real).  Fix: `n_rs_batch = common_speculative_n_max() + 1` through
`llama_context_params`/`llama_cparams`/`ggml_gated_delta_net` (new op param 1) into the CUDA threshold
`max(K > 16 ? K : 16, n_rs_batch)` and the `seq_rm` guard, plus the pre-batch ssm/conv state written
into slot `n_tokens` when `0 < n_tokens < K`.  Validated on gfx1151: in-tree
`test-recurrent-state-rollback` **FAIL -> PASS** (`max diff 6.5366, first at seq 0 pos 16` ->
`max diff 0`), `GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46, and neutrality on the delivery configs (27B
`plain == draft-mtp n_max 7` = `e164f09af338`, qwen4exp `plain` = `0fc4910d5824`, pp within noise).

**Item 9 — the configurable QSA prefill arm + the device-query arm gate (closed 2026-09-12 (9), block-14 amendment).**
Two changes in `src/models/qwen4exp.cpp`.  (a) The prefill axis of the arch policy was not
depth-configurable at all (only the decode crossover was); it now is — `qsa_dense_prefill_until`
(env `LLAMA_QSA_DENSE_PREFILL_UNTIL`, `K/M/G` suffixes, `0` disables the arm) lets a prefill ubatch
whose `n_kv` is still below the threshold attend dense while storing the indexer keys, so the sparse
path takes over above it.  **Its default is `0` = QSA prefill always on every arch and split, which is
the documented ARCH POLICY** (`beta/qwen4exp/README.md`: "prefill is always QSA"; 2026-09-07 crossover
record: Soar QSA wins prefill from ~8K to +181 % @160K, Halo from ~16K; a first pass that tried to set
a default from a whole-prompt `llama-bench` A/B was corrected by the maintainer — dense is never better
for prefill there, and that record already rejects the whole-prompt shape as non-comparable with its
at-depth tables).  The delivery's default behaviour is therefore **byte-identical to the pre-amendment
build** (f16 `0fc4910d5824`, q8_0 `e8f8bba3942b` = the recorded pre-amendment shallow values;
`plain == draft-mtp n_max 3 == n_max 7`), so no reference hash moves and the arm is an opt-in A/B.
(b) `qsa_kv_native`'s hand-maintained copy of the kernel's type list is replaced by a
`ggml_backend_dev_supports_op()` query on a shaped probe tensor, so the gate is the back-end's own
answer — and under `-sm tensor` the Meta device's `all_of()` *is* the meta-split safety condition; the
`LLM_FUSED_OP_FLASH_ATTN_QSA` probe the item suggested is structurally impossible (no QSA node exists
in a reserve-time graph).  Gates: strict 15/15 apply (tree == canonical), `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 22/22,
predicate table 0 mismatches (with `D=80` newly rejected), default byte-identical to pre-amendment,
beta block-15 re-cut 14th on the new base (which also folded the missing `nullptr, nullptr` argument
into the beta commit).  Record: `archive/work/strix-halo/qsa-item9/RECORD-2026-09-12-qsa-prefill-crossover.md`;
`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §26; `WORKLOG.md` 2026-09-12 (9).

**Item 11 — the MXFP4 fused gate+up+GLU MMQ is not reachable; the type-list enablement is a no-op (closed 2026-09-12 (8)).**
Implemented and measured the planned change (add `GGML_TYPE_MXFP4` to `MMQ_GATE_TYPES` + the generated
gate instance, the `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q_switch_type_gate` case, and `moe_mmq_type`): it builds and is
bit-identical where it runs, but it **never fires** on the available MXFP4 MoE (`gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4`).
That model's MoE graph is the expert-bias `{MUL_MAT_ID, ADD_ID, MUL_MAT_ID, ADD_ID, GLU}` pattern, whose
only fused arm is the **mmvq/decode** one — there is no MMQ (prefill) fused arm for it, and the MMQ fused
epilogue carries no `x_bias`/`gate_bias`/scale support.  Evidence: instrumented gate counter -> 0
firings over a full prefill with the arm enabled; pp2048 1741.3 vs 1742.0 t/s and pp16384 1506.7 vs
1501.6 t/s (fused vs `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MOE_MMQ_FUSION=1`, ×2, within noise); same-seed greedy text
byte-identical (`6c1cdaa5d52d`).  So the item's premise (a type-list/instance edit) does not buy anything;
the real feature would be a bias/scale-aware MMQ fused gate, worth doing only if a plain 3-op MXFP4 MoE
appears.  Experiment reverted (no delivery change).  Side finding to fix before adding any gate type:
`generate_cu_files.py`'s `SOURCE_MMQ_GATE` re-emits the file header when appending, so re-running the
generator mutates the 5 committed gate instance files.
  **Re-checked 2026-09-21: no longer reproduces, CLOSED.**  `SOURCE_MMQ_GATE` is now the single line
  `DECL_MMQ_CASE_GATE({type});\n` (the header comes from the earlier `'w'` pass over `TYPES_MMQ`), so
  the `'a'` pass appends only that declaration.  Verified by running `generate_cu_files.py` in a
  throwaway copy of `template-instances/` and diffing: **0 changed files, 0 new files**, i.e. the
  generator is idempotent against the committed instance set (which is what the r6 build-time split
  requires, since those files are part of block 13/15's patches).  Keep the check in mind if the
  generator is edited again: it is cheap and it guards a delivery-critical invariant.

**Item 14 — canonical-fork hygiene: closed, verified (2026-09-12 (8)).**  The policy (never regenerate
from a drifted `~/llama.cpp`; rebuild at `9113cc188` via `scripts/apply-all.sh`) lives in `AGENTS.md` and
`BASELINE.md`.  The canonical chain was re-verified on 2026-09-12: strict 15/15 `git am`, applied tree
`f4791066f4a582316b1ca95f51c96cd10b905ef7` == canonical, tip `13af95ac1`, `make-patches.sh` default tip
updated.  The superseded artifacts are the pre-merge record only.


**Item 5(f) — the block-13 fused MoE gate+up+GLU arm still wins on Strix Halo (closed 2026-09-12).**
Re-measured on the current delivery tip (35B-A3B Q4_K_M, 1 GPU, `-p 2048`/`-p 16384`, interleaved
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MOE_MMQ_FUSION` off/on ×3): fusion active **+0.6 %** at pp2048
(1711.9/1710.2 vs 1710.1/1701.4 t/s) and **+0.6 %** at pp16384 (1485.3/1485.8 vs 1476.4/1478.6), the
fusion fires, prefill absolute ~1710/1485 t/s.  So the arm is **kept** (a small but real Strix win).

**The gfx1151 dense-decode-at-every-depth policy (TODO item 7, closed 2026-09-12).**  The proposed
workaround (force gfx1151 decode dense at every depth, so the sparse regime becomes unreachable) was
motivated by the sparse regime's recorded width impurity.  Re-measured 2026-09-12: the two recorded
items were artifacts of the block-13 RDNA3_5 mmvq fusion (fixed the same day), and the sparse regime is
**pure** in the default configs (deep sparse ~74K: f16 `83e0ed0f0f80`, q8_0 `7205399d367d`), so gfx1151
**keeps the 64K crossover** (sparse wins deep decode).  A pure per-*perf* MTP-side crossover re-measure
is parked — no purity driver.  The one recorded residual (the q8_0/q5_0 forced-sparse item) is now
fixed (block-14 amendment (eighth); gfx1151 cross-check validated 2026-09-12 (14));
record `archive/work/strix-halo/RECORD-2026-09-12-qsa-sparse-width.md`, analysis `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §18.

**The gfx1151 within-band mmvq fusion variance (block 13, closed 2026-09-12 (2)).**  The 2026-09-11
block-13 band work made the *standalone* mmvq path `W = 1..8`-uniform, but on gfx1151 two
**single-token-only** fusions still ran at `W=1` only and their fused kernels do not reproduce the
standalone arithmetic, so a 1-token decode and an n-token verify of the same layer were not
bit-identical (the issue-25 "block-13 `n_q=1` short-K mmvq variance"): the dense gate+up+GLU mmvq fusion
(`mul_mat_vec_q<..., ncols=1, has_fusion=true>`) and the MoE weighted-down tail
`ggml_cuda_mul_mat_id_weighted_rdna3_5`.  Fixed by guarding the six `{op,op,GLU}` /
`{op,bias,op,bias,GLU}` matchers in `ggml_cuda_try_fuse` (keeping the band-uniform `MUL_MAT_ID`/MoE
fusions) and `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_id_weighted_rdna3_5_ok`, both RDNA3_5-only unless
`GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_RDNA3_5_SINGLE_TOKEN_FUSIONS=1`.  Post-fix `W = 1,2,4,8` one hash per config: qwen4exp
f16 `453eaa61`, q8_0 `113696b9`, MoE 35B-A3B `18999a78`; the 27B dense (`e165ef98`) was already pure and
is unchanged; cost ≈ −0.9 % `tg128` (the purity-first trade, follow-up = item 16).  Canonical tip
`13af95ac1`, tree `f4791066f4a582316b1ca95f51c96cd10b905ef7`; `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §25, `WORKLOG.md`
2026-09-12 (2), `archive/work/strix-halo/rdna35-mmvq-fusion-purity/README.md`.

**The fused shared-expert epilogue's band cost (TODO item 10, closed 2026-09-12).**  The
band-uniformity fix's `grid = (nrows, ncols)` launch shape (one block per `(output row, token)`,
down-weight row re-read per token, 7 of 8 warps idle on the 35B-A3B geometry) is replaced by a
`ncols_dst`-templated kernel with the token loop inside the k-block loop and `grid = (nrows)` — a
**bit-identical** restructure (old-vs-new `.so` A/B: every gate hash equal, incl. the MoE probe
`W = 1..8` `ac8825358d9adfda` and MTP `0.87179`) that repays the item-5 cost: `pl=8` 461.0 -> 475.4
t/s (+3.1 %), `pl=4` 299.1 -> 306.5 (+2.4 %), `pl=1` flat, and the fused default now beats the
unfused reference at every width.  Block-13 patch anyway; see the 2026-09-12 WORKLOG entry,
`patches/README.md`'s 2026-09-12 section and `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §24.

**The gfx1201 (RDNA4) port of the gfx1151-gated campaign items (2026-09-11 (12) note — mostly closed
2026-09-06/07).**  Every gated kernel was ported and is enabled by default on RDNA4: the
**routed-compact MoE MMQ** (`mmq_routed_compact_arch_ok() = RDNA3_5 || RDNA4`,
`2026-09-06-gfx1201-rdna4-routed-moe-mmq.md`: +4-8 % prefill, byte-identical, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MMQ_ROUTED=1`
to A/B), the quantize chunk (flat, kept), and the block-13 fused MoE gate+up+GLU MMQ is **ungated
outright** for RDNA3_5 *and* RDNA3_0 (2026-09-05).  **Phase 2.5 (the fallback-path probe) is DONE
2026-09-12:** the routed-compact path's "bit-identical" claim holds on both MoE models (qwen4exp IQ4_XS
text `804de0576868`, 35B-A3B Q4_K text `68c0a24ed8d4`, both identical with `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MMQ_ROUTED`
on/off; `W = 1..8` and MTP `0.87179` identical) and the perf reproduces (+4.0..+11.1 % / +5.1..+7.8 %
prefill, tg flat), with two wording corrections: the Q4_K model *does* take the routed path (480
`mul_mat_q_routed_compact` launches per pp512 — the real control is that the dispatch is prefill-only, 0
launches in a `tg` run), and `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MMQ_ROUTED=1` isolates only the compact *enumeration*
(the per-expert J selection stays active in both arms).  What remains is validation on other boxes — see
item 6.  The plan doc (`archive/work/qwen4exp/gfx1201-porting.md`) carries a status banner; its checkboxes are
stale.

**Issue #25's GDN plain-vs-MTP divergence (2026-09-11 (12)) — FIXED and re-verified.**  The `K`-dependent
chunked/sequential boundary in `gated_delta_net.cu` was removed by block 02's **K-independent whole-batch
chunked prefill** (Option B, 2026-09-11): both the plain (`K == 1`) and the MTP (`K == n_max + 1`) prefill
now make the *same* call, so the post-prefill state no longer depends on `n_max`; `GGML_CUDA_GDN_ALIGN_BOUNDARY`
and both K-dependent branches were deleted and `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0` remains as the A/B switch and the
fully-snapshot-safe fallback.  **Re-verified 2026-09-11 (12) on the current tree** (27B Q8_0, 2-GPU
`-sm tensor -ts 1/1`, `p0long.txt`, 512 greedy tokens, `-c 8192 -ctk f16 -ctv f16 -fa auto`):
`--spec-type none == draft-mtp n_max 1 == 4 == 5` → all `299566b902bb` (2727 chars), byte-identical.
(With `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0` the plain text differs → `60777872b890`, which is the expected
chunked-vs-sequential kernel difference, not a plain-vs-spec divergence.)  The stale status lines in
`archive/work/issue-25-mtp-batch-width/GDN-CHUNKED-PREFILL-{FOLLOWUP,FIX}.md` (they still describe the opt-in
`GGML_CUDA_GDN_ALIGN_BOUNDARY` fix, a gate that no longer exists) are corrected there.

**Block 15 dense-arm blocker (2026-09-11 (11)) — FIXED, one line.**  `LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0` gave PPL
`1.0558` for every KV type because the top-k mask chain's `ggml_tensor * kq_mask_top_k` shadowed the outer
declaration added by the V2/V3 refactor, so the attention got a null mask (a full causal leak).  Found via
the node dump (the map: the delivery consumed `attn_inp_kq_mask` 36×, the beta 0×) and a `[QDM]` log
(`kq_mask=1` … `outer_top_k=0`).  Ninth beta re-cut: base `6d3155faa` → tip `3712e2dc1`, tree
`e39f8c2b6f0593113b93c4e57c512bc7373a2250`, patch 3 811 lines; oracle sparse `6.5394` / dense `6.5377`,
dense texts and random-text PPL byte-identical to the delivery, production arm untouched.  Details:
`archive/work/block15-dense-arm/HANDOVER-2026-09-11-block15-dense-arm.md`, `WORKLOG.md` 2026-09-11 (11),
`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §23, `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/BETA-TESTING.md` §4c.  Follow-ups filed: `-Wshadow`
(item 15) and the residual `iq4_nl` W2 sensitivity (accepted, above).

**KV-quant purity / parity campaign — ALL CLOSED (2026-09-11).**  Brief, evidence and tooling:
`archive/work/kv-quant-purity-followups/` (`README.md` + `tools/`); analysis: `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §14–§22.
- **F1** (`q8_0`/`q4_0` dense-band impurity) — FIXED as a block-08 amendment: the FA kernel-family
  chooser returned VEC for `n_q <= 2` with a quantized K/V and TILE above; the branch is deleted (the
  whole band is TILE), all four split configs `W=1..8` bit-identical, cost tg128 −0.5…−0.9 %.
- **F2** (qwen4exp width impurity) — all three causes fixed: the HC `nt == 1` gates (block-14 amendment),
  upstream's per-type **mmvq cap** in `mul_mat_vec_q_moe`'s `__launch_bounds__` (block-13 amendment,
  +14–26 % at the verify widths), and the QSA dense decode arm gated `n_tokens == 1` (`QSA_DECODE_BAND
  = 8`, block-14 amendment).
- **F3** (sub-`q8_0` KV parity) — both steps landed: `q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1` (block-08 + block-14 amendments,
  2026-09-11 (8)) and `iq4_nl` (block-08 + block-14 amendments, 2026-09-11 (10); 4B pp512 2269.8 → 7931.8,
  tg32 48.5 → 95.0, `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` 5935/5935, `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 22/22).  The QSA quantized-KV
  enablement also root-caused a **quality bug** every purity gate was blind to (the shared staging tile
  mixed two K/V heads at gqa 12; perplexity 7.33 → 6.53) and added the CPU oracle + `FLASH_ATTN_QSA`
  test.  Open remainders are items 3 and 9 above.
- **F2's superseded framing** ("multi-step / roll-back", "the fused sparse QSA path", "same cause as F1")
  was wrong on all three counts — the corrected record is `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §13–§16.

**Other closed work** (each with a dated record):
- 2026-09-10 block 00 added (FA small-batch KV-split width invariance, issue #25, + the Vulkan masked-V
  fixes); block 06 reduced to a host-buffer rationale marker on the re-base (upstream reverted #24233).
- 2026-09-11 block 02: the K-independent whole-batch chunked GDN prefill (`GGML_CUDA_GDN_ALIGN_BOUNDARY`
  and its K-dependent branches deleted, + rollback guard) — `patches/README.md`.
- 2026-09-06 sched-gate fix (`c63f7f2a0` / delivery `d6eb551`) validated on both arches; the pre-reboot
  "flake" was a degraded box.  Records: `beta/qwen4exp/README.md`, `archive/work/qwen4exp/gfx1201-porting.md`.
- 2026-09-06 WS4 Strix Halo hc-prefill-fusion gates PASSED (depth-0 pp +5.2–8.8 %, decode flat) —
  `archive/work/wip-archive/qwen4exp/discovery/2026-09-05-strix-halo-gfx1151-ws4-hc-fusion-gates.md`.
- 2026-09-06 real determinism root cause fixed (the indexer top-k `atomicAdd` gather scrambled the QSA
  list order run-to-run; replaced with an ascending count/scan/write) + the stale-cell zeroing port.
- 2026-09-05 WS3 #2 (QSA dense-shortcut artifact) root-caused to `ggml_gallocr_reserve_n_probe` /
  the dense↔sparse topology flip and fixed at the ggml level; WS3 #3 (routed-compact MoE MMQ) landed for
  gfx1151, default on.  Records: `...ws3-shortcut-fix.md`, `...ws3-routed-moe-mmq.md`.
- 2026-09-05 block 13's fused MoE MMQ ungated for RDNA3_5 (gfx1151: pp2048 +5.3 %, pp16384 +4.6 %) and
  for RDNA3_0 (gfx1100: pp2048 +9.4 %, pp16384 +7.8 %), both with coherence IDENTICAL and the RDNA4 J
  caps transferring.  Records: `...gfx1151-block-13-moe-mmq.md`, `...rdna3-gfx1100-block-13-moe-mmq.md`.
- 2026-09-05 the scale→unary fusion port (`ggml_cuda_op_scale_unary`, bit-identical, pp2048 +0.34 %).
- 2026-09-05 ITEM B (QSA sparse-FA latency push) closed at ~48 t/s / ~95 % GPU occupancy — the probed
  3× headroom never materialised (register pressure, CU occupancy, VRAM bandwidth).
- 2026-09-05 expert-tiering experiment dropped (see Parked); 2026-09-06 the IQ3_XXS/IQ4_XS shard-1
  "truncation" turned out to be a metadata-only first shard (non-issue).
- 2026-09-01…09-04: block 13 released (fused MoE gate+up+GLU MMQ + mmvq item-split); the multi-token
  MUL_MAT_ID `x_scale_channel_dst` fusion; the ROCm unaligned-width split-load fix; the two block-13 MTP
  regression fixes (mmvq ksplit dispatch for verify batches, the rms_norm fold gated to single-token
  MMID); the block-12 NCCL-failure fallback (issue #13); the qwen4exp WIP promotion to `beta/qwen4exp/`
  and its re-base onto `8b4b3558f` with the MTP draft head.

## 2026-10-04 (r10) - block 01: `LLAMA_MTP_DRAFT_OP_OFFLOAD=0` (contributor PR #98, @briansp2020); block 06: correct the device-gather comment

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r10`, same fork point **`a55e952b8`** (tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`).  New canonical tip **`b86854900`**, net tree
**`dab5186bc0527508156507fd323a9109924cb03e`**.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: strict 16/16
`git am`, applied tree == `release.json.tree`.  **Blocks 01 and 06 change.**

### (1) Block 01 - the MTP draft context can keep its host ops on the host (PR #98)

**Why.**  With the expert cache armed (`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB`), the MTP draft context reserves
full-size device copies of its host-resident expert tables (the qwen4exp shared Q8_0 head's experts
under `-otd exps=CPU`).  `LLAMA_MTP_DRAFT_OP_OFFLOAD=0` builds the draft context with
`op_offload = false` so those ops run on the host and the copies are not reserved.  This is a
contributor PR; our first review reported "no measurable gain", which was a **measurement error**:
the saving only appears when the expert cache is armed, and that test had not armed it.

**The change** (`common/speculative.cpp`, 9 lines): after setting `cparams.ctx_type =
LLAMA_CONTEXT_TYPE_MTP`, read `LLAMA_MTP_DRAFT_OP_OFFLOAD` and set `cparams.op_offload = false` when
it is `0`.  Opt-in: unset keeps the previous behaviour.

**Verified** (gfx1201, 3x R9700, qwen4exp UD-IQ3_XXS + shared Q8_0 head, `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=4096`,
`-c 262144`, author's flags): draft device compute **2054.25 -> 1444.06 MiB**; post-load VRAM
**20027 -> 19417 MiB** (610 MiB).  The reporter measured ~1.1 GB on their larger head
(2550.47 -> 1444.33 MiB), and the `=0` floor matches ours to 0.3 MiB, so the floor is
model-independent and the difference is the head's expert size.  A 3-rep full 58.8k-token prefill
A/B is 549.3 t/s unset vs 541.0 t/s `=0`, within noise, so the switch is memory-only.  Output
unaffected.  Record: `archive/work/mtp-draft-op-offload/`.

### (2) Block 06 - the device-gather comment no longer cites the corrupted pass (comment only)

The `SCHED_GATHER_TABLE_MIN_BYTES` comment in `ggml-backend.cpp` claimed a large expert table was "a
permanent gather win" and cited "qwen4exp 450 MiB table gather 3052 vs staging 1403 t/s".  Those
numbers came from the **corrupted** gather pass in which NaN routing skipped expert work (see
`archive/work/moe-mmq-overread/RESOLUTION.md`).  The comment now states that the gather stays default-off
(`GGML_SCHED_DEVGATHER=1` is an A/B switch only) and that a corrected gather loses to staging even
for the 450 MiB table (the reporter's PCIe 5.0 x16 measurement, ~35 % slower).  No runtime change.

### Regression gates

Dense 4B 3-GPU `-sm tensor` `1c5d32ac537d`; the #98 draft-reserve A/B above; `validate-set.sh`
green.

## 2026-10-04 (r9) - block 12: non-RDNA4 internal all-reduce on by default + NCCL failover (issue #86); block 14: relax the gemma4 `-sm tensor` gate (issue #99)

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r9`, same fork point **`a55e952b8`** (tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`).  New canonical tip **`6d4ac7a52`**, net tree
**`6cf4f5323691e429c69ff2d8a404749eb1f93fad`**.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: strict 16/16
`git am`, applied tree == `release.json.tree`.  **Blocks 12 and 14 change.**

### (1) Block 12 - the internal/hybrid HIP all-reduce is no longer RDNA4-only (issue #86)

**Why.**  Tensor parallelism needs at least one working AllReduce.  The block-12 `hybrid`
algorithm is RCCL for large (prefill) tensors plus the internal host-staged pipeline for small
(decode/verify) tensors, but `ggml_cuda_ar_pipeline_init` was gated to RDNA4
(`gfx1200`/`gfx1201`), so on gfx1100 `hybrid` degenerated to RCCL-only.  On a PCIe root port
without AtomicOp completer support RCCL refuses to dispatch (`hipErrorIllegalState`, ROCm/ROCm#6520)
and the runtime fallback re-routes to the meta butterfly, which is what hangs (issue #86, 2x
gfx1100).  The internal pipeline was built for exactly this - it stages every tensor through
mapped pinned host memory and needs no peer access or system atomics - and was only gated because
that is where it was validated.

**The amendment** (`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/allreduce-hip.cu`, `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/ggml-cuda.cu`):

* The arch gate is bypassed by default on every HIP arch, with a one-time UNVERIFIED warning on
  non-RDNA4: `GGML_CUDA_AR_ALLOW_NON_RDNA4` defaults to **1** and `=0` restores the RDNA4-only
  gate.  A machine with a single GPU never reaches the comm layer, so the change is inert there.
* The first AllReduce call whose selected (non-internal) function fails is now re-served through
  the internal pipeline instead of returning false and letting the meta butterfly run.  Later calls
  already took the internal path through the existing `nccl_failed` early-out.

**Verified** (gfx1201, 3x R9700, ROCm 7.14.1): the env is a no-op on RDNA4 (no warning) and the
dense 4B `-sm tensor` same-seed gate is **`1c5d32ac537d`** with the default and with
`GGML_CUDA_AR_ALLOW_NON_RDNA4=0`.  Clean build.  **Not hardware-validated on gfx1100 here** (no
RDNA3 pair); the reporter has not yet confirmed on their box, so this is promoted on the strength
of the design, the pre-existing 2x-RDNA3-behind-x4 deployment record and the gfx1201 no-op.  The
promotion follows the default-on policy: the env var is now the opt-out.

### (2) Block 14 - the gemma4 `-sm tensor` guard is relaxed (issue #99)

**Why.**  The block-14 `llm_arch_supports_sm_tensor()` gate rejected `LLM_ARCH_GEMMA4` outright
because the fused expert tensor (`ffn_gate_up_exps`) has a segmented split layout and the per-ubatch
upload of a host-resident MoE (`-ncmoe`) had no correct tensor-split path.  The gate's own comment
noted the all-resident case was fine, but the arch-level rejection made it unreachable.  Two
upstream fixes for the fused-QKV split, **#28965** (`fb27a525d`, split state/granularity) and
**#29294** (`f805c57a2`, uneven K/V head sizes), are in the `a55e952b8` base.

**The amendment** (`src/llama-arch.cpp`, `src/llama-model.cpp`): `LLM_ARCH_GEMMA4` is removed from
the false-list (allowed); `LLM_ARCH_GEMMA4_ASSISTANT` (the MTP head) is added to it; and
`llama_model_create()` now rejects a gemma4 tensor split only when a host-resident expert override
is configured (`-ncmoe`/`-cmoe`, detected by testing the `tensor_buft_overrides` patterns against a
gemma4 expert weight name and checking the target buffer is not a GPU/IGPU).

**Verified** (gfx1201, 3x R9700, all `--seed 42 --temp 0`):

* gemma-4-26B-A4B Q8_0 and gemma-4-31B Q6_K, `-ngl 99 -sm tensor`, are byte-identical to `-sm layer`.
* `-ngl 40 -sm tensor` (whole layers on CPU) still runs.
* `-ncmoe 40 -sm tensor` fails **cleanly** with the new "host-resident experts ... use -sm layer"
  message; before this change it aborted with `GGML_ASSERT(split_state.nr[0] == 1)` in
  `ggml-backend-meta.cpp` (reproduced here with `-ncmoe 40 -ub 128`).
* gemma4 MTP (`-md gemma-4-31B-it-Q8_0-MTP.gguf --spec-type draft-mtp`) + `-sm tensor` fails
  **cleanly** with `not implemented for architecture 'gemma4-assistant'`; before, it aborted with the
  meta ratio assert in `ggml-backend-meta.cpp:1212`.  MTP + `-sm layer` still works.

### Regression gates

Dense 4B `-sm tensor` `1c5d32ac537d` (default and `GGML_CUDA_AR_ALLOW_NON_RDNA4=0`); gemma4
all-resident == `-sm layer`; `validate-set.sh` green.

## 2026-10-05 (r8) - block 06 amendment: skip the H2D staging calibration when a split has no host weight (issue #97)

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r8`, same fork point **`a55e952b8`** (tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`).  New canonical tip **`05bbd56e0`**, net tree
**`af02d2d4bb9823fefa3a80d4a3e147c6ac5a48cc`**.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: strict 16/16
`git am`, applied tree == `release.json.tree`.  **Only block 06 changes**
(`ggml/src/ggml-backend.cpp`).

**Why.**  Issue #97 (@DanoPTT): the one-off H2D bandwidth calibration in
`ggml_backend_cuda_stage_h2d_gbps()` allocates a 512 MiB device buffer, times three copies, then
`cudaFree`s it.  On their Windows 11 / ROCm 10.0 (TheRock) box the per-process GPU memory counters
stay ~512 MiB higher for the rest of the run, and a dense full-offload server (no `-ncmoe`, no
`-ot`) paid for a probe it never used: the 27B Q5 at 161K ctx spilled into shared memory and decode
fell from 46.8 to 16.4 t/s (r36 + `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MIN_TOKENS`, which skips the calibration, is
43.6 t/s).  The calibration ran because `sched_stage_issue()` called `sched_stage_min_tokens_for()`
- which triggers it - before the loop that looks for host-resident weights, so a split with no host
weight still reached it.

**The amendment.**  `sched_stage_min_tokens_for()` now computes
`sched_stage_host_weight_bytes(split)` once and returns 0 immediately when it is zero, so the
calibration (inside `sched_stage_min_tokens()`) is never reached for a split that has nothing to
stage.  A split that does carry a host weight calibrates exactly as before; the explicit
`GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MIN_TOKENS` override and the `GGML_SCHED_STAGE=0` opt-out are untouched.  The
probe itself stays a bare `cudaMalloc` (the Windows accounting behaviour is the driver's, not the
scheduler's), but a dense run no longer reaches it.

**Verified** (gfx1201, 1x R9700): a dense full-offload `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` run at `-lv 4` no longer
logs `H2D bandwidth calibration` / `H2D staging calibration`; a
`gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-UD-Q4_K_XL` `-sm layer -ncmoe 99` prefill still logs both (14.5 GB/s ->
min_tokens=1542, now measured at the first host-weight split instead of at startup).  Same-seed
greedy (`--seed 42 --temp 0`) is byte-identical to r7 for both a dense 4B (`c10fd88999c5`) and the
`-ncmoe` MoE (`d4313ad642b8`); the delivery's dense 3-GPU `-sm tensor` 4B gate is `1c5d32ac537d`
unchanged.

## 2026-10-05 (r7) - block 06 + block 15 amendment: auto-size the H2D staging ring (issue #93)

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r7`, same fork point **`a55e952b8`** (tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`).  New canonical tip **`27b6254e7`**, net tree
**`77ee997c9fad231ea64ffb3a4247a1d158819b48`**.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: strict 16/16
`git am`, applied tree == `release.json.tree`.  **Blocks 06 and 15 change**: block 06 takes the
scheduler half (`ggml/src/ggml-backend.cpp`), block 15 the ring + accounting
(`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/common.cuh`, `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/ggml-cuda.cu`, `src/llama-context.cpp`,
`src/llama-model.{h,cpp}`).

**Why.**  Issue #93 (@briansp2020): qwen4exp's host-resident expert tables are 450 MiB and the
op-offload H2D staging ring was capped at the fixed `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MAX_MB` default of 2048 MiB.
Eight 450 MiB slots need ~3.6 GiB, so the fifth growth tripped the budget and the scheduler set
`stage_enabled = false` **for the rest of the run** - every remaining MoE split fell back to the
serial pruned host copy (the reporter's trace: 30 % H2D, 0 % overlap).  A bigger ring recovered
**+42 %** at `-ub 2048` on their PCIe5 x16 box.  A second bug interacted with it: the staging width
gate (`sched_stage_min_tokens`) is calibrated from the link bandwidth against a **144 MiB**
reference table, so a 450 MiB table was staged at widths where the whole-table copy loses to the
pruned serial path (maintainer's x4 box, `-ub 2048`: 653 serial vs 525 staged).

**The amendment.**

* **Auto-sized ring budget** (`common.cuh`): when `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MAX_MB` is unset the budget is
  `h2d_stage_slots() x (largest slot ever requested + 512)`, so a full ring always fits the table it
  feeds; an explicit value still wins.  `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_SLOTS` (default 8) is the shared depth.
* **Table-size-scaled gate + graceful fallback** (`ggml-backend.cpp`): the threshold is scaled by
  `host_table_bytes / 144 MiB` (`GGML_SCHED_STAGE_TABLE_REF_MB` overrides the reference; `0`
  disables the scaling) and `sched_stage_issue` now plans the whole split before uploading, so a
  shortfall skips that split without disabling the ring and never emits a partially staged split.
* **`--fit` accounting** (block 15): `h2d_stage_bytes()`/`h2d_stage_bound()` are exposed through the
  CUDA reg, `llama_model::max_host_weight_tensor_bytes()` supplies the bound, and
  `llama_context::memory_breakdown()` counts the raw ring in the live and `no_alloc` paths.
* **The device gather is untouched** and stays default-off (`GGML_SCHED_DEVGATHER`); the `////`
  corruption was the gather, not the ring.

**Measured** (soar, gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14, 1x R9700 PCIe5 x4; Qwen3.8-Flash-Next UD-IQ3_XXS,
`-ncmoe 48 -sm layer -fa 1 -lm none -lzm off`; **`-lzm off` is required** - the managed lazy reader
re-faults the PLE weights during prefill and makes the run-to-run noise larger than the effect).
`llama-bench -p 8192 -n 0 -b 8192 -ub <U> -r 3 -t 8`:

| 4096 | 1142 | 1071 | gated - staging would lose 6 % |
| 8192 | 1570 | **2374** | **+51 %** |

r6's fixed 2048 MiB default was the serial column at every width.  No regression on the campaign's
144 MiB reference (35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M `-ncmoe 99`: `-ub 8192` 3059 -> 4002 as before; `-ub 2048`
1444 -> 1504) and the 2-GPU `-sm tensor` path (qwen4exp: `-ub 8192` 1887 -> 2268).  **Purity:**
same-seed greedy, 5246-token prefill + 64 tokens, `GGML_SCHED_STAGE=0` vs `=1` **byte-identical**
(`9b38c3005063`, 0 `////`).  A `llama-server` (`-ub 8192`, `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MIN_TOKENS=64` so a
WebUI prompt reaches the gate) ran a WebUI session without incident.  `test-backend-ops -o

## 2026-10-05 (docs + gfx1150 target) - issue #88: gfx1150 (Strix Point) validated and added to the prebuilt target set

The GHCR images were built for `gfx1100;gfx1151;gfx1200;gfx1201` while `README.md` listed `gfx1150`
under RDNA3.5, so a Strix Point iGPU had no code object and failed on the first kernel launch
(`ROCm error: device kernel image is invalid`).  Reported by @louisremi, who supplied the
`HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.5.1` workaround.  With a Strix Point host (Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / Radeon
890M, `gfx1150`, ROCm 7.14.1) available, the target was validated and added.

* **Build.** `-DGPU_TARGETS="gfx1150;gfx1151" -DAMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx1150;gfx1151"` builds clean;
  `libggml-hip.so.0` carries both `amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx1150` and `...--gfx1151` code objects.
* **Gates.** `GET_ROWS` 220/220, `MUL_MAT_ID` 931/931, `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` 6358/6358, `FLASH_ATTN_QSA`
  26/26, `INDEXER_TOPK` 3/3, `HC_MIX` 30/30, `GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46, `RMS_NORM` 51/51 on the
  native `gfx1150` code.
* **Purity.** Same-seed greedy `llama-cli` (9B Q8_0, 24 tokens) is byte-identical across two native
  runs and against the `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.5.1` `gfx1151` arm (116 chars,
  `sha=0fcee4c7c9cb`).
* **Speed.** `llama-bench` 9B Q8_0, native `gfx1150` vs the `gfx1151` override: `pp512` 577.27 vs
  580.30 t/s, `tg128` 10.61 vs 10.65 t/s (within noise).

Changes: `.devops/rdna-rocm.Dockerfile` adds `gfx1150` to `ROCM_DOCKER_ARCH`
(`gfx1100;gfx1150;gfx1151;gfx1200;gfx1201`); `CONTAINERS.md` gains a Strix Point section (native
target plus the override for images published before this change); `README.md` and the
`wiki/Home.md` mirror point at it.  No patch/block change and no release bump; the new code object
ships with the next image build.

## 2026-10-05 (r6) - issue #95 fixed: dynamic-backend (Docker) builds allow `-sm tensor` for qwen4exp

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r6`, same fork point **`a55e952b8`** (tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`).  New canonical tip **`1d10390a8`**, net tree
**`2b57533c8002d11bd047c75a3323b30229f7f526`**.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: strict 16/16
`git am`, applied tree == `release.json.tree`.  **Only block 14 changes**; block 15 re-based onto it
(body unchanged).

Reported by @ethanjjjjjjj: the published `server-rocm-10.0` container rejects `-sm tensor` for
qwen4exp (`LLAMA_SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR not implemented for architecture 'qwen4exp'`) while a source
build on the same ROCm 10 hosts works.  The root cause is a build-configuration difference, not a
code difference: the Dockerfile builds with `-DGGML_BACKEND_DL=ON -DGGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS=ON`, and
`ggml_add_backend()` only publishes `GGML_USE_<backend>` on the `ggml` target when
`GGML_BACKEND_DL=OFF`.  So `src/llama-arch.cpp`'s `#ifdef GGML_USE_HIP` (the qwen4exp tensor-split
gate) compiled to the HIP-absent branch in the containers even though the HIP backend was built.

Fix: `ggml/src/ggml-hip/CMakeLists.txt` now also does
`target_compile_definitions(ggml PUBLIC GGML_USE_HIP)`, so the macro reaches `llama` (which links
`ggml`) in both static and dynamic-backend builds.  The static build already had it from
`ggml_add_backend(HIP)`; CMake deduplicates the target property, so its flags are unchanged.

Verified on a local configure matching the Dockerfile (`-DGGML_HIP=ON -DGGML_BACKEND_DL=ON
-DGGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS=ON -DLLAMA_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DGPU_TARGETS=gfx1201`): before the fix the
`llama` target's `flags.make` had no `-DGGML_USE_*`; after it has `-DGGML_USE_HIP`, and
preprocessing `src/llama-arch.cpp` emits the `LLM_ARCH_QWEN4EXP` case as `return true`.  The static
`build-rocm` (`GGML_BACKEND_DL=OFF`) rebuilt clean with no flag change.

## 2026-10-05 (r5) - contributor PR #96 folded into block 06 (scheduler re-stage for a second MUL_MAT_ID consumer)

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r5`, same fork point **`a55e952b8`** (tree

`git am`, applied tree == `release.json.tree`.  **Only block 06 changes**; blocks 07-15 are re-based
onto it (bodies unchanged, `From`/`index` lines move).

PR #96 (@briansp2020, accepted on `main` as `wip/sched-moe-restage/`, then promoted here): with
`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB` armed, qwen4exp's MTP draft acceptance collapses after a prefill while the
target output stays correct.  `ggml_backend_sched_split_graph` registered a weight as a split input
only when it first created the copy, so when the same host-resident expert weights fed `MUL_MAT_ID`
in two splits the later split reused the earlier split's copy.  The expert cache had taken that copy
over for its 1-row decode-band consumer (`moe_cache_take_over` aliases `weight_cpy` and never fills
`input_cpy`), and the later full-row export op is outside the cache band, so it read stale bytes -
NaN in `t_h_nextn`, which reached the drafter's KV and every slot.  The fix registers the weights as
an input of the current split as well (once per split) when the copy already exists and the node is
a `MUL_MAT_ID` reading WEIGHTS through `src[0]`, so the split stages them for its own routing.
Single-consumer graphs are unchanged.  Detail: `archive/work/sched-moe-restage/RESULTS.md`; the WIP
record (README + patch) is kept beside it.

## 2026-10-05 (post-r4) - the `qsa-standard-fa` WIP resolved (no delivery change)

No release; the delivery `patches/` and `release.json` are untouched.  The campaign (handover item 5
of the `lightning-indexer-fusion` follow-up) investigated running qwen4exp's sparse attention on
upstream's standard `ggml_flash_attn_ext` `n_kv_max` mechanism instead of the fused
`ggml_flash_attn_qsa`.  Full record: `archive/work/qsa-standard-fa/RESULTS.md`; the WIP code is on
the disposable fork branch `qsa-standard-fa` (`98af9d949` + `f1211f784`), net diff
`archive/work/qsa-standard-fa/results/phase0/phase1-2-port.patch`.

**Outcome: Option A adopted as a non-destructive capability, Options B and C dropped on
measurement.**  Upstream's dense-mask compaction (`flash_attn_mask_to_sparse_indices` /
`ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_compact_mask`) is ported to HIP (`__ballot_sync` wrapped as
`ggml_cuda_ballot` for AMD's 64-bit member mask), `shall_use_sparse` is arch-aware for
WMMA/MFMA, and the `use_sparse=true` MMA instantiation is enabled for HIP behind
`GGML_CUDA_FA_SPARSE=0` (with `GGML_CUDA_FA_SPARSE_TRACE=1` as the "was it actually sparse?"
harness).  Two constraints decide the rest:

* **AMD needs `ncols1*ncols2 >= 16`** (`flash_attn_ext_f16`'s `AMD_WMMA_AVAILABLE` guard), so
  upstream's `(512,512,1,8)` / `(256,256,1,8)` sparse shapes cannot launch on AMD (forcing one
  traps with `HIP kernel … has no device code`).  Only `(576,512,1,16)` and `(256,256,8,8)` are
  legal; the `(576,512,1,16)` arm is verified sparse-correct on gfx1201.
* **The compaction prepass is O(n_kv)** (it scans the whole dense mask every call), which is why
  the standard path cannot win at long context.

Measured at qwen4exp geometry (head 256, gqa 12, top-k/`n_kv_max` = 2048, `n_q = 1`, gfx1201,
`test-backend-ops perf`): fused `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` **43.6 µs @16k / 43.2 µs @65k** (flat in context)
vs standard sparse **75.7 / 111.8 µs** vs dense FA **100.8 / 346.7 µs**; q8_0 KV 36.5 vs 85.1 vs
111.0; `n_q = 4` 80.1 vs 99.7 vs 272.1.  The fused kernel is **~1.7-2.6× faster**, so routing
qwen4exp through the standard path would be a decode regression (and would re-open the width-purity
band), and deleting the fused kernel is unjustified.  **Recommendation: keep `patches/` as-is.**
Gates on the minimal port: `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` 6358/6358 ×3 (0 failures), oracle sweep 59/59,
`FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 26/26, sparse-hint subset 21/21.

## 2026-10-05 (r4) - the `lightning-indexer-fusion` WIP resolved

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r4`, same fork point **`a55e952b8`** (tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`).  New canonical tip **`cd1485fd1`**, net tree
**`714f94f050dfce08c987a8a14467f456fe6e9d60`**.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: strict **16/16**
`git am` on a fresh `a55e952b8` tarball, applied tree == `release.json.tree`.  r4 ships the
`lightning-indexer-fusion` resolution together with the already-committed
`qwen4exp-qsa-convergence` block-14 amendment (the entry below).  Full record:
`archive/work/lightning-indexer-fusion/RESULTS.md`.

**The only delivery change is item 2 of the handover: register our fused indexer-score nodes as
`LLM_FUSED_OP_LIGHTNING_INDEXER`.**  Upstream `889edf43d` does this in its kpool `build_qsa_sel`;
we dropped it with the rest of the kpool graph.  Adopted in both places our graph materialises the
score: the fused decode op (`ggml_indexer_score`) in **block 14**, and the prefill WMMA arm
(`ggml_lightning_indexer`) in **block 15** (which introduces that arm).  It lets
`resolve_fused_ops()`'s Lightning Indexer probe report a layer/device mismatch instead of the
indexer silently falling off the layer's device.  **It is inert today**: the base sets
`cparams.auto_flid = false` unconditionally, so `llm_fused_op_lid_probe` never runs.  Adopted anyway
because it is exactly upstream's code and a zero-risk alignment.

**The other four items are dropped/deferred with evidence:**

* **Item 1 (`llama_prefetch_rows` in the PLE path) — DROP, measured regression.**  The fork's PLE
  `set_input` already queues every gathered row's page with `MADV_WILLNEED`, and the managed
  reader prefetches its cold pages with `fadvise` + an I/O pool.  Replacing that with the generic
  `llama_prefetch_rows` is byte-identical but ~15-20 % **slower**: qwen4exp Flash-Next IQ4_NL
  3-GPU `-lm none`, pp512 (interleaved `-r 4`) **1542/1530** pristine vs **1450/1507** with the
  registration only vs **1220/1208** with the prefetch helper.  Keep the fork's loop.
* **Item 3 (per-head score) — DROP/DEFER.**  Upstream's final form is the fused
  `ggml_lightning_indexer` (already our prefill WMMA band); the per-op chain is the deliberate
  gfx1100 issue-#59/#60 path and `GGML_QSA_SCORE_MEM` already in-places the relu and chunks the
  peak.  No gfx1100 here to validate the memory claim.
* **Item 4 (seed-free mask) — DROP (already done).**  Upstream `4e2713c16` is the kpool
  `build_qsa_sel`; our `build_attn_qsa` already fills the mask in place and builds `zeros` from a
  fresh tensor, with no seed.
* **Item 5 (standard FA kernels take the top-k index list) — DEFER.**  A large separate campaign;
  the fused `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` kernel stays the RDNA fast path.

### Validation (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14, `~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714`)

* Clean `all`-target build from the final tip, warning-free.
* `test-backend-ops`: `INDEXER_TOPK,INDEXER_SCORE,FLASH_ATTN_QSA,HC_MIX` **59/59** on ROCm0/1/2;
  `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **6358/6358** on each.
* Coherence unchanged: dense 4B 3-GPU `-sm tensor` `1c5d32ac537d`; qwen4exp Flash-Next IQ4_NL
  3-GPU `-sm tensor -lm none --reasoning off -n 20` `359ff4337837` (and `-lm auto` identical).
* `tg128` (`-p 0 -n 128 -r 4 -lm none`) 56.4 t/s vs pristine 57.1 - within noise.
* `scripts/validate-set.sh` green (base `a55e952b8`, 16 blocks, applied tree
  `714f94f050dfce08c987a8a14467f456fe6e9d60`).

### Delivery record

* Block 14 amended (`b9a4c4814`): the decode fused-score registration.  Block 15 re-based onto it
  and amended (`cd1485fd1`): the WMMA prefill registration; the rebase applied with no conflicts and
  the 14-15 delta is exactly those lines.  `patches/0014`/`0015` regenerated; `release.json`
  tip/tree/hashes and release name updated to `v16-a55e952b8-r4`; `patches/README.md`
  block-14/15 notes.

## 2026-10-05 (qwen4exp-qsa-convergence, UNRELEASED on `main`) - block 14 adopts upstream's `hc_init` split fix

**No release tag.**  This is the `wip/qwen4exp-qsa-convergence/` resolution, pushed to `main` as an
intermediate state; it will ship in **`v16-a55e952b8-r4`** together with the
`wip/lightning-indexer-fusion/` fold.  `release.json.release` stays `v16-a55e952b8-r3` while the tip
advances.  Fork point `a55e952b8` unchanged; new canonical tip **`b6529d088`**, net tree
**`c77aeb55c91972257e228adca4cbcaa30d649be5`**; `validate-set.sh` green (strict 16/16 `git am`,
applied tree == `release.json.tree`).

**Decision: keep the fork's fused QSA graph (A), adopt the one applicable upstream qwen4exp-local fix,
defer kpool convergence (B/C) and the derived-cache-vs-kpool memory question (item 4).**  Full audit +
rationale: `archive/work/qwen4exp-qsa-convergence/DECISION.md`.

### What changed (block 14, `src/models/qwen4exp.cpp`)

Adopted upstream `10f340d1a`'s `-sm tensor` placement fix verbatim:
```cpp
cb(res_hc, "hc_init", -1);
// make sure hc_init is in the same graph split as the first layer (-sm tensor).  Upstream
// 10f340d1a; without it the REPEAT stays on the CPU when the PLE gather is a CPU node and the
// meta splitter views a host-resident reshaped node.
ggml_build_forward_expand(gf, res_hc);
```
The graph already carried the analogous `ggml_build_forward_expand(gf, ple_emb)` for the PLE input,
so this is the same idiom.  It is byte-identical on the delivery gates (below); it is inert while the
`-sm tensor` gate is HIP-only, but removes a latent meta-split hazard and keeps us aligned with
upstream.

### Audit findings (why nothing else was taken)

* **No dead qwen4exp kpool code** (item 3): `qwen4exp.cpp` has no kpool symbol; the kpool
  declarations in `models.h` are in `llama_model_glm5_next`.  Both pooling stacks in
  `llama-memory-hybrid-idx.*` are live - `set_input_qsa`/`get_pool`/`build_qsa_top_k` for qwen4exp,
  `set_input_kpool`/`build_inp_kpool`/`gather_mla_rows` for glm5-next.  r2's qwen4exp-hybrid
  replacement had already deleted the spliced code.
* **`66e0c17ee`, `159c651f5`, `4e2713c16`, `889edf43d`** are all the kpool/lightning-indexer graph we
  deliberately do not use; the RDNA analogues are `wip/lightning-indexer-fusion/`.  Their
  shared-infra halves (`llama-memory-hybrid-idx.cpp`, `llama-hparams.h`, MTP/recurrent/model files)
  are already in the tree (base) and serve glm5-next.
* **`c061df198` (MTP)** shared-infra is in the tree; the fork's MTP is independent and validated.
* **`-sm tensor` gate** (item 2) stays HIP-only: our non-AMD blocker is the *fused* QSA/HC ops' CPU
  fallback, not the PLE/`hc_init` placement upstream fixed.  On ROCm the split was already allowed
  and remains the 3-GPU gate.

### Validation (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14)

* Incremental rebuild of the amended tree: dense 4B 3-GPU `-sm tensor` `1c5d32ac537d` (unchanged);
  qwen4exp Flash-Next IQ4_NL 3-GPU `-sm tensor -lm none --reasoning off -n 20` `359ff4337837`
  (unchanged).
* `scripts/validate-set.sh` green (base `a55e952b8`, 16 blocks, applied tree
  `c77aeb55c91972257e228adca4cbcaa30d649be5`).
* Blocks 15 re-based onto the amended block 14; bodies unchanged (only hunk line numbers / `From`
  lines move).

## 2026-10-05 (r3) - the `mmq-prec-gate-fp4` and `shared-expert-fusion-reconcile` WIPs resolved

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r3`, same fork point **`a55e952b8`** (tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`).  New canonical tip **`3d1cd47f2`**, net tree
**`25a8e137a585cd9fc2907a74236998f881635b8e`**.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: strict **16/16**
`git am` on a fresh `a55e952b8` tarball, applied tree == `release.json.tree`.  Both follow-up WIPs
(`wip/mmq-prec-gate-fp4/`, `wip/shared-expert-fusion-reconcile/`) are resolved and archived under
`archive/work/`.  **Only block 13 changes content** (two `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/mmq.cu` guards + one
`ggml-cuda.cu` comment); blocks 14/15 are re-based onto the amended block 13 (their `From` lines
change, bodies do not).

### `mmq-prec-gate-fp4` - the merged MMQ precision/gate parameter contract

The r1 re-base merged upstream `e9f824d8c`'s `ggml_prec prec_src1` into the slot block 13 used for
`bool has_gate`, with `prec_src1` **before** `has_gate` through the whole stack
(`mul_mat_q_process_tile<type,J,fallback,fixup,prec_src1,has_gate>`, `mul_mat_q`,
`launch_mul_mat_q`, `mul_mat_q_switch_J`, `mul_mat_q_case<type,prec_src1,has_gate>`),
`DECL_MMQ_CASE_GATE` = `mul_mat_q_case<type, GGML_PREC_Q8, true>` and `DECL_MMQ_CASE_W4A4` =
`mul_mat_q_case<type, GGML_PREC_Q4>`.  The order is audited correct; the follow-up closed the
hardcoded-Q8 risk:

* `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q_switch_type_gate` now takes the `prec_src1` `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q` already
  computed and asserts `prec_src1 == GGML_PREC_Q8`.  The fused gate types
  (`Q3_K/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q8_0/Q6_K`) and their instantiations are never FP4, so this is a no-op today;
  a future FP4 gate type now fails loudly instead of silently hardcoding Q8 and disabling the
  Blackwell W4A4 path.
* `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q_pair` asserts neither weight is `NVFP4`/`MXFP4` (the dispatch in
  `ggml_cuda_try_fuse` already excluded them; the pair has no fp4 quantize + scale path).
* Both `DECL_MMQ_CASE_W4A4` and `DECL_MMQ_CASE_GATE` expand in the generated `mmq-instance-*.cu`
  files.  `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT,MUL_MAT_ID` **2235/2235** with `GGML_CUDA_MMQ_PREC=q8` and
  **2235/2235** with `=q4`.  No Blackwell / sm_120+ hardware here, so the W4A4 arm itself is a
  scope-policy waiver (consistency only).

Full record: `archive/work/mmq-prec-gate-fp4/RESOLUTION.md`.

### `shared-expert-fusion-reconcile` - the three shared-expert arms are disjoint

Upstream's base `bed0a8566` fused shared-expert MMVQ (`ggml_cuda_match_shared_expert`,
`{MUL_MAT_ID, MUL_MAT_ID, GLU, MUL_MAT, MUL_MAT, GLU}` -> routed GLU + shared GLU) and block 13's
`ggml_cuda_op_shexp_down_gate` epilogue (`{MUL_MAT, MUL_MAT, SIGMOID, MUL, ADD, ADD}` -> final
`l_out`) are **disjoint** node sets.  A temporary `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_TRACE` instrumentation on
gfx1201, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B `Q8_0`:

* `-sm layer`: `upstream_shared` **200x** and `shexp_down_gate` **160x** on one 2-token pass - both
  fire, on the same layers - the direct non-overlap proof.
* `-sm tensor`: `upstream_shared` **0x**, `shexp_down_gate` still fires.  Upstream's
  `std::rotate` graph reorder still runs for every layer, so the matcher engages at
  `graph_optimize` time; the failure is at compute time: the routed expert is sharded along its
  FFN axis with the `lcm(blck_size,128)` granularity (128 for Q8_0) while the shared expert is
  mirrored, so `weight->ne[1] (128) != shared_weight->ne[1] (512)` and the fusion correctly
  declines.  This is inherited upstream behaviour, not a merge regression.
* The default-off `LLAMA_HC_BLK16` MWR merge consumes the `ffn_out` ADD and so intentionally
  replaces the block-13 epilogue when armed.

Decision: **keep both**; the precedence/complementarity is now documented at the `shexp_down_gate`
matcher in `ggml-cuda.cu`.  No functional change.  Full record:
`archive/work/shared-expert-fusion-reconcile/RESULTS.md`.

### Validation (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14, `~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714`)

* Clean `all`-target build, warning-free.
* `test-backend-ops`: `MUL_MAT,MUL_MAT_ID` **2235/2235** at `GGML_CUDA_MMQ_PREC=q8` and `=q4`;
  `MUL_MAT_ID` 931/931; `HC_MIX` 30/30; `RMS_NORM` 51/51; `ARGSORT` 78/78; `INDEXER_TOPK` 3/3;
  `GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46.
* Coherence unchanged: 4B dense 3-GPU `-sm tensor` `1c5d32ac537d`; qwen4exp Flash-Next IQ4_NL
  3-GPU `-sm tensor -lm none --reasoning off -n 20` `359ff4337837`.
* `scripts/validate-set.sh` green (base `a55e952b8`, 16 blocks, applied tree
  `25a8e137a585cd9fc2907a74236998f881635b8e`).

## 2026-10-05 (r2) - re-base follow-ups resolved: every block builds + integration audit

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r2`, same fork point **`a55e952b8`** (tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`).  New canonical tip
**`dbe88ea6e3afd86da26ce766ae8b71d2b26b67ac`**, net tree
**`c38ba8f2066f01c3a1f69207a7e0860e5026ef17`**.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: strict **16/16**
`git am` on a fresh `a55e952b8` tarball, applied tree == `release.json.tree`.  The previous release
was `v16-a55e952b8-r1` (tip `def454e4c`, tree `6a44aa2904772db02dbc88960397efe8138498df`).  The two
r1 follow-up WIPs (`wip/rebase-merge-hygiene/`, `wip/rebase-integration-audit/`) are resolved and
archived under `archive/work/`.

### Merge hygiene — every block commit now builds

The r1 chain's intermediate commits did not build; the post-rebase "build fixes" commit had only
covered what the *final* tree needed.  A clean configure+build of every commit (`all` target) found
**eight** independent breaks, redistributed to the earliest block owning each (see
`archive/work/rebase-merge-hygiene/RESOLUTION.md` for the full table):

* **block 01** — `tests/test-recurrent-state-depth.cpp` batch-API migration; the `n_rs_batch`
  `llama_context_params` field + default-init moved here (the test uses it, the field was added at 02).
* **block 02** — `llama-model.cpp`'s general `llama_memory_hybrid_idx` ctor call was missing the
  `n_rs_batch` argument block 02 added.
* **block 03** — `fattn-mma-f16.cuh` gfx11 signed-zero guard said `!swz_V`; upstream collapsed the
  booleans to `swz`.
* **block 04** — `fattn.cu` had an extra `}` closing the kernel chooser early; and
  `llama-context.cpp`'s tensor-split FA hint called `ggml_backend_dev_is_cuda` before its (block-15)
  definition, so the helper moved here.
* **block 08** — `ggml-cuda.cu` was missing the `}` that closes the `RMS_NORM→SCALE` fusion `if`,
  nesting the rest of `ggml_cuda_try_fuse`.
* **block 13** — the `prec_src1 × has_gate` MMQ merge: `mmq.cu` missing `}`, `mmq.cuh` missing the
  `DECL_MMQ_CASE_W4A4` `#define`, `mmvq.cu`'s `mul_mat_vec_q_ksplit` `stride_col_dst` `const`.
* **block 14** — `llama-memory-hybrid-idx.cpp` missing the `}` closing `set_input_kpool`; and the
  unreconcilable `qwen4exp.cpp`/`models.h` hybrid (a QSA class header spliced onto a kpool class body
  plus upstream's kpool graph routing) was replaced by the coherent pre-block-15 QSA implementation
  from the **r37 block-14** commit + the tip's matching `models.h`.  Block 15 keeps its genuine
  r37-block-15 qwen4exp delta, so the 14→15 patch stays non-empty.
* **block 15** retains the fix-commit's own self-fixes (DFlash batch API, `s_copy_tail`,
  `test-backend-ops` brace, the two shared-expert braces).

A clean-configure `all`-target build is green at **every one of the 16 commits**.  The first sweep
was misleading because the reused build cache kept the tip's `GGML_CUDA_FA_QUANTS`, making blocks
00-07 look like configure failures.

### Integration audit — one real finding (`archive/work/rebase-integration-audit/RESULTS.md`)

* **DFlash device path** (`GGML_LF_DFLASH_DEV=1` vs `=0`): byte-identical, plain (`1acb04bd9104`)
  and M-RoPE/long-prompt (`1866e197bc4f`).
* **`common_sampler_clone`** (S2 + `.rng`): `test-speculative-adaptive` OK; greedy and probabilistic
  MTP drafting both clean; `GGML_LF_FAST_TOPK=0/1` byte-identical (`6ff72e08d38b`).
* **Argsort tie-break — FINDING + FIX.**  A new `test_argsort` `ties` variant with duplicate-heavy
  rows (`{2048,8,1,1}`, `{4096,2,1,1}`, spanning several bitonic blocks) **failed on the r1 tree
  (74/78)**: the CUDA `bitonic_step` is index-stable (matches CUB and the fused MoE router) but the
  CPU oracle `cmp_argsort` compared values only, so `std::sort` on a large row was unstable.  The
  comparator is now a total order with an index tie-break; `ARGSORT` is **78/78**.  This is a runtime
  change and is the only reason the r2 tree differs from `6a44aa29…`.
* **Recurrent-state-depth sweep** runs on the migrated batch API (counts are config-dependent and
  pre-existing; no new regression — the runtime files are otherwise byte-identical to r1).
* **glm5-next `n_rs_batch`** is compile-only (no GLM5-Next model); documented waiver.

### Validation (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14, `~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714`)

* `all` target green at all 16 commits (fresh configure each).
* `test-backend-ops`: `ARGSORT` 78/78, `MUL_MAT_ID` 931/931, `RMS_NORM` 51/51, `INDEXER_TOPK` 3/3,
  `HC_MIX` 30/30, `GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46.
* `test-speculative-adaptive`: all tests OK.
* Coherence unchanged: 4B dense 3-GPU `-sm tensor` `1c5d32ac537d`; qwen4exp Flash-Next IQ4_NL
  3-GPU `-sm tensor -lm none --reasoning off -n 20` `359ff4337837`.
* `scripts/validate-set.sh` green.

### Note on `release.json.tip`

The canonical chain is the rebuilt `dbe88ea6e…`; the fork's `rdna-boosts` branch was reset to it.
The `From <sha>` lines in `patches/*` therefore changed (new block SHAs) while every block body is
the r1 body plus the redistribution above.

## 2026-10-05 (r1) - re-base: 16-block set moved onto upstream master `a55e952b8`

**Release** `v16-a55e952b8-r1`, new fork point **`a55e952b8`** (upstream master, 2026-10-03, tree
`3550faf840a88ae652e5ff8d32067f28a836d87b`), canonical (rebased) block-15 tip
`def454e4c`, net tree `6a44aa2904772db02dbc88960397efe8138498df`.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green on
a fresh `a55e952b8` tarball: checksums, base tree, strict **16/16** `git am`, applied tree ==
`6a44aa29…`.  `rdna-boosts-all.patch` and `release.json` regenerated.  The previous baseline was
`84e76d8a2` (release `v16-84e76d8a2-r37`); this moves the set forward **203 upstream commits**.

The re-base was done by replaying the real block commits (not `git format-patch` + `git apply`) with
`git rebase --onto a55e952b8 84e76d8a2`, so the three-way merges had the canonical blobs available.
Blocks 00, 02-07 and 09-12 replayed without textual conflict (some hunks auto-merged); blocks
01/08/13/14/15 needed manual resolution.  Build fixes found after the replay are folded into block 15
(the same pattern as the r1 re-base's post-rebase compile fix).

### Conflicts resolved (all preserving our work; upstream folded in where independent)

* **Block 01, `common/speculative.cpp`** — upstream's `1fb7ef3e3` probabilistic draft sampling
  (`dp.result_q`, `spec_retune`, conditional sampler reset) overlapped the adaptive-MTP hunks.  Kept
  both: `begin()` now resets the sampler *and* the adaptive controller; the `n_cap`/`n_last`
  bookkeeping was migrated to the new batch API.
* **Block 01 + 15, batch API migration** — upstream `f1ea20621`/`60e9cf7a7` replaced
  `common_batch_add`/`llama_batch` with the `common_batch.add`/`llama_batch_ext`/`llama_process` API.
  Our `common/speculative.cpp` and `tests/test-recurrent-state-depth.cpp` hunks were migrated
  (`batch.add(...)`, `llama_process(ctx, LLAMA_PROCESS_TYPE_DECODE, batch.get())`).
* **Block 08, `argsort.cu`** — upstream `6a2743f02` factored the bitonic compare-exchange into
  `bitonic_step<order>`.  Our index tie-break (the fused MoE router's deterministic order) moved into
  the helper, so widths > one block keep our bit-exact tie handling.
* **Block 08, `norm.cu`** — upstream `1ab7e5ad2` added `rms_norm_f32_cuda<true>`/`scale_out` for the
  GDN q/k l2norm while block 08 had its own `rms_norm_scale_f32` (scale+bias).  **Retired our
  separate fusion** and took upstream's `do_scale` path (the `ggml_cuda_can_fuse` matcher below now
  drives it); our call site and kill switch `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_RMS_SCALE` were dropped.  Block 15's
  `dst16`/`store_f32` bf16-output arm was merged into the same kernel signature
  (`scale_out, dst16, store_f32`).
* **Block 08, `mmvq.cu` / block 13, `mmvq.cu`** — upstream `bed0a8566` added the fused shared-expert
  MMVQ launch (`fusion.shared_up`, `nchannels_dst + (fusion.shared_up != nullptr)`).  Merged into our
  `c_rpb`/ksplit short-K grids and the `mul_mat_vec_q_moe` shared-expert + expert-cache cold seam
  (`channel_x`/`gate_channel_x` resolve to 0 for the shared lane).
* **Block 08/15, `unary.cu`** — upstream `2090f60f0` generalized the BF16 cast
  (`ggml_cuda_cast<T>`).  Combined with block 15's `store_f32`/`dst16` output arm in both the unary
  and gated kernels, and extended upstream's new BF16 dispatch branches.
* **Block 13, `mmq.cu`/`mmq.cuh`** — the hard one: upstream `e9f824d8c` added a `ggml_prec prec_src1`
  template parameter exactly where block 13 had `bool has_gate`.  Kept `has_gate` and inserted
  `prec_src1` **before** it through the whole stack
  (`mul_mat_q_process_tile<type,J,fallback,fixup,prec_src1,has_gate>`,
  `mul_mat_q`, `launch_mul_mat_q`, `mul_mat_q_switch_J`, `mul_mat_q_case`), restored
  `DECL_MMQ_CASE_W4A4`, and made the fused-gate dispatch pass `GGML_PREC_Q8`.
* **Block 14, qwen4exp** — upstream added its own qwen4exp work: `c061df198` MTP, `66e0c17ee` fixes,
  `4e2713c16` mask construction, `889edf43d` indexer-score memory, and `10f340d1a` `-sm tensor`
  re-enable; it refactored the QSA block mechanism into a generic kpool (`set_input_kpool`,
  `llm_graph_input_kpool`, `build_inp_kpool`, `build_qsa_sel`).  Our fused-op implementation (r37:
  `build_qsa_top_k`, `build_qsa_store_k`, `llm_graph_input_qsa`, the derived block-vector cache) is
  **kept as the qwen4exp graph**; upstream's kpool machinery coexists in the hybrid-idx memory and
  serves glm5-next, but is not wired into our qwen4exp model.  `models.h`'s qwen4exp class and
  `qwen4exp.cpp` were restored to the r37 (self-consistent) versions, adapted to upstream's core:
  `s_copy_extra` -> `s_copy_tail` (`436f6f89e`), and `n_rs_batch` threaded into upstream's new
  glm5-next `llama_memory_hybrid_idx` constructor.
* **Block 15, `common/sampling.cpp`** — upstream's `1fb7ef3e3` copies `rng` in
  `common_sampler_clone`.  Kept upstream's `.rng` plus block 15's S2 scratch/`fast_*` fields.
* **Block 15, `llama-context.cpp`** — upstream's training branch and our `packed_kq_mask` reserve
  argument merged; `extract_layer_inputs` keeps upstream's `bool` return and our F1 device path
  (`return true`).
* **Block 15, `llama-memory-hybrid-idx.{h,cpp}`** — upstream's kpool functions and our QSA
  derived-cache functions are disjoint; both sets are kept (`set_input_qsa`/`get_pool`/
  `qsa_score_key_limits` + upstream's `set_input_kpool`/`kpool_access`/`gather_mla_rows`).

### Retired / superseded

* Block 08's standalone `rms_norm_scale_f32` kernel and `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_RMS_SCALE` call site —
  subsumed by upstream `1ab7e5ad2`.
* Block 08's runtime `use_rpb_moe` MoE launch path — superseded by block 13's compile-time `c_rpb`
  (already the pre-rebase state; the re-base re-applied the merge).
* Our tensor-split gate for qwen4exp at the model level is untouched; upstream's `10f340d1a`
  re-enable of `-sm tensor` is shadowed by our own arch gate on ROCm.

### Validation (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14, `~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714`)

* Clean `-j16` build, warning-free.
* `test-backend-ops`: `MUL_MAT_ID` **931/931**, `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **6358/6358**, `HC_MIX` **30/30**,
  `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` **26/26**, `INDEXER_TOPK` **3/3**, `GATED_DELTA_NET` **46/46**,
  `RMS_NORM` **51/51**, `SCALE` **7/7**.
* Dense coherence: `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0`, 3-GPU `-sm tensor`, same-seed greedy `1c5d32ac537d` (the
  long-standing gate hash).
* qwen4exp: `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next` IQ4_NL on 3x R9700 fully VRAM resident (`-sm tensor`,
  `-lm none`, `--reasoning off`, `-n 20`): hash **`359ff4337837`** (the r26/r37 gate).  Benchmarks
  must use `-lm none` (no mmap) so the PLE weights are not re-read from disk on every prefill:
  `llama-bench -p 512 -n 0 -r 6` = **1448 ± 16** pp512 t/s, `-p 0 -n 128 -r 6` = **55.8 ± 5.5**
  tg128 t/s (without `-lm none` the first prefill rep is cold, ~668 ± 265).
* `scripts/validate-set.sh` green (base `a55e952b8`, 16 blocks, applied tree
  `6a44aa2904772db02dbc88960397efe8138498df`).

### Follow-ups

* The 16 block commits keep their `rdna-boosts: block NN:` subjects.  Block 14's intermediate
  (pre-block-15) content is the re-based hybrid; block 15 carries the final conflict resolution, so
  a fresh 16/16 `git am` produces a clean final tree (validated above).
* Upstream's qwen4exp kpool/lightning-indexer path is currently dead for qwen4exp (kept for
  glm5-next); a follow-up could re-port our fused INDEXER_TOPK/FLASH_ATTN_QSA/hc ops onto it, or drop
  the dead code.

## 2026-10-05 (r37) - release: BF16 hyper-connection hc_mix fusion folded into block 15

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r37`** (canonical tip `f39945172993fa4a7517b6a5af8821d7eef36c3a`, tree
`ea5f8012f30d1aef94f1b3057ae58897fff0d61a`; `validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied
tree == `release.json.tree`).  Only **block 15** changes in content.  The contributor PR
[#91](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/pull/91) (@briansp2020) is folded in.

* **The gap.**  Block 14's fused hyper-connection mixer `GGML_OP_HC_MIX` was implemented for Q8_0 hc
  weights only.  The ISTA-DASLab GSQ-RCO quants keep `hc_{attn,ffn}_{down,up,inject}` in **BF16**, so
  `build_hc_mix`'s gate failed and those models ran the six-dispatch unfused chain (rms×gamma, down
  `mul_mat_vec_f`, scale+silu, up `mul_mat_vec_f_vb`, `dsv4_hc_pre`, inject `mul_mat_vec_f`) - 96
  mixers per token.  Decode on those models is dispatch-bound (~2,400 dependent launches/token at
  2.6-3.2 µs each, ~4 ms of gaps on top of ~16 ms of kernels).
* **The fix (PR #91).**  A BF16 arm for `ggml_cuda_op_hc_mix` replays the unfused BF16 chain in
  **three** dispatches with the same per-thread K order and reductions (bit-identical):
  `hc_mix_rms_gamma_quant` without the quantize; the down rows and the inject rows in one grid
  (`mul_mat_vec_f<bf16,float,nt,256>`); and the up rows of the four hc streams of one column plus the
  gated collapse in one block (`mul_mat_vec_f_vb<bf16,160,4>` + `dsv4_hc_pre_f32`), with the gate kept
  in shared memory.  It is **not** a precision or memory trade: the weights are already BF16 on those
  models, and Q8_0-hc models already have a 4-dispatch fused path.  No weights are converted.
* **Integration + hardening.**  `LLAMA_HC_MIX_BF16=0` keeps the chain.  The CUDA support predicate and
  the `build_hc_mix` gate both require `hc_lr == 320` (the emulated `mul_mat_vec_f_vb` block) so an
  unsupported low-rank cannot reach the kernel's `GGML_ASSERT`; `ggml_hc_mix`'s asserts accept BF16.
  The CPU `HC_MIX` reference (`ggml_compute_forward_hc_mix_f32`) gained the matching BF16 arm, so a
  BF16 op that lands on CPU (non-CUDA backend fallback, `-ot` CPU) runs a reference instead of
  aborting.
* **Pre-existing bug found and fixed.**  Adding the BF16 cases to `test-backend-ops` surfaced a bug in
  the CPU reference: it hard-coded the dst row stride as `n_embd + hc`, but with no inject tail the
  tensor row is `n_embd`, so the no-inject path wrote token `it > 0`'s head at the wrong offset.  The
  reference now uses `n_embd + (w_inject ? hc : 0)`.  The GPU BF16 kernel was correct (the cases pass
  after the reference fix).
* **Validation (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14).**  Clean `-j16` build (`test-backend-ops`, `llama-cli`).
  `test-backend-ops -o HC_MIX` **30/30** on all three R9700s (20 Q8_0 + 10 BF16, `nt` 1/2/3/5/8).
  End-to-end on a BF16-hc Flash-Next fixture (the local Q4_K_M's hc weights are Q8_0, so a copy was
  requantized with `--tensor-type ...=bf16` and pruned to 4 layers): fused (default) vs
  `LLAMA_HC_MIX_BF16=0` is **byte-identical** for `-ub 3/5/8` (all `8ada57e4b2bd7522`, `nt` 1/3/5/8),
  run-to-run deterministic, and a temporary probe confirmed the fused kernel launches; `llama-bench -n
  256 -r 5`, three interleaved rounds, gives **292.69 vs 281.95 t/s (+3.8 %)** on that 4-layer fixture
  (the contributor's full 48-layer model reports +4.9 %).  The fixture and its conversion are throwaway
  - the source model was never modified.  Strict 16/16 `git am`, `validate-set.sh` green (applied tree
  `ea5f8012f30d1aef94f1b3057ae58897fff0d61a`).
* **Provenance:** merged as `e39dc74` (`wip/rdna4-hc-mix-bf16`); record and independent validation in
  `archive/work/rdna4-hc-mix-bf16/` (`README.md` + `VALIDATION-gfx1201-2026-10-03.md`).

## 2026-10-05 (r36) - release: issue #89's indexer top-k block-path fix folded into block 15

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r36`** (canonical tip `9b8b6f10815d285cd7f8828ab431686937873085`, tree
`c595f29253ad70d693793d010f5e5399dadf57ae`; `validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied
tree == `release.json.tree`).  Only **block 15** changes in content.  The contributor fix
[PR #90](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/pull/90) (issue #89, reported by
@briansp2020) is folded in.

* **The bug.**  The fused indexer top-k's block fast path (`indexer_topk_radix_cuda_blocks` in
  `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/indexer-topk.cu`, block 15) runs radix pass 1 at cell level, passes 2-4 at block
  level, then gathers (`indexer_topk_write_blocks_grouped`) at cell level.  Each hist-block `h` owns
  blocks `[h*bchunk, (h+1)*bchunk)` in the block passes but cells `[h*bchunk*r, (h+1)*bchunk*r)` in the
  gather, so the histogram-derived `g_cnt`/`e_cnt` per-range bases are only right when block `b`'s cells
  are `[b*r, b*r+r)`.  That fails for a unified KV holding several sequences (blocks are keyed by
  (sequence, position bucket)), and for a single sequence once the KV head has moved past cell 0.  Some
  output entries were left unwritten (stale bytes or overwritten): out-of-range stale bytes made
  `flash_attn_qsa` gather K/V at a garbage address (GPU page fault, server hang), and in-range stale
  bytes silently attended to the wrong cells.  The per-row radix totals are partition-independent, so
  the selection threshold was already correct; only the per-range bases were wrong.
* **The fix (PR #90).**  After the last radix pass a new `indexer_topk_count_cells_grouped` kernel
  recounts `g_cnt`/`e_cnt` over exactly the cell ranges the gather walks, with the gather's own key
  logic (block key plus `cell_pos`/`q_pos` visibility).  Passes 2-4 stay block-level.  For the
  from-cell-0 case the new counts equal the old ones, so output is unchanged; the cost is one extra
  cell-level pass.
* **Regression test.**  `tests/test-backend-ops.cpp` gains `test_indexer_topk_block` (registered as
  `INDEXER_TOPK`), which builds the op directly with a derived-bias/derived-visibility layout and
  compares CUDA against the CPU reference as a set: a from-cell-0 control, a one-sequence offset cell
  map, and a two-stream (unified KV) map.  The two mismatching shapes **fail on the unfixed r35 build
  and pass on r36**, so the block/cell partition contract now has an oracle.
* **Validation (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14).**  Clean build.  `test-backend-ops -o INDEXER_TOPK` **3/3**,
  `TOPK_QSA` **4/4**, `LIGHTNING_INDEXER` **225/225**, `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` **26/26**, `MUL_MAT_ID`
  **929/929**.  Output-preserving: 4B `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` `-sm tensor` `-n 64` = `7386359e5dac` and
  35B-A3B `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Q8_0` `-sm layer -ncmoe 40` `-n 48` = `cf7f8b23f404`, both identical to r35.
  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree
  `c595f29253ad70d693793d010f5e5399dadf57ae`, canonical tip `9b8b6f108`.
* **End-to-end reproduction (the reporter's model).**  Qwen3.8-Flash-Next UD-IQ3_XXS (the local 77 GB
  copy), one R9700, `-ngl 99 -sm layer -c 65536 --n-cpu-moe 24 -ub 256 -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 -cram 2048`,
  `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=1024`, `GGML_SCHED_SYNC_GRAPH_INPUTS=1`, two concurrent about-8k-token
  requests with the second starting 13 s after the first.  The **unfixed r35 kernel dies** with
  `Memory Fault Error ... kernel: void flash_attn_qsa<256, (ggml_type)8, false>(...)`, `Memory access
  fault ... Reason: Page not present or supervisor privilege` (type 8 = Q8_0, the reporter's fault),
  and the server process exits; the **fixed r36 kernel completes the same sequence cleanly** over
  three replays with the server still alive.  Two calibration notes: a sequential two-slot run is
  **not** sensitive, because with `-kvu` the idle slot is saved and cleared when the next request
  arrives, so the sequences never coexist; and `-np N` explicitly disables the auto unified KV, so
  `-kvu` is required to reproduce.  The fault is timing-dependent (concurrent batching), which is why
  the focused `INDEXER_TOPK` oracle above is the permanent gate.
* **Provenance:** the PR was merged as `8f0c54f` (`wip/indexer-topk-block-fix`); this release archives the
  record as `archive/work/issue-89/` and folds the code and test into block 15.  Reporter's setup is
  qwen4exp (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next) with a unified KV, and `LLAMA_INDEXER_NOBLOCK=1` avoided it as a
  workaround.

## 2026-10-04 (r35) - release: issue #87's synchronous graph-input fix is default-on

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r35`** (canonical tip `b01620f2de060d546b945786a2eee4fc04cd0248`, tree
`d08fbaf2ca842ea3c3ce044ac45c0a8d0f11c597`; `validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied
tree == `release.json.tree`).  Only **block 06** changes in content.  The issue #87 reporter confirmed
that the r33 opt-in candidate fixes their `HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_APERTURE_VIOLATION`, so the default
flips from off to on.

* **Default-on.**  `sched_sync_graph_inputs()` now returns true when `GGML_SCHED_SYNC_GRAPH_INPUTS` is
  unset (`e == nullptr || atoi(e) != 0`); `=0` restores the r26 async behaviour for A/B / bisection.
  The variable is still read, so the reporter and bisectors keep the kill-switch.
* **What it does (unchanged from r33).**  The r26 op-offload H2D path copies a host-resident split input
  with `ggml_backend_tensor_set_async` straight from the host pointer.  The recurrent-state copy
  `rs_s_copy` is always consumed through views (`s_copy_main` / `s_copy_extra`) and `ggml_view_*` does
  not propagate `GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_INPUT`, so the views took the async branch; the host overwrites
  `rs_s_copy` in `set_input()` on the next ubatch, so the copy could read the next ubatch's value, a
  torn one, or race a reused split buffer.  Resolving the view chain with
  `ggml_backend_sched_graph_input()` and taking the synchronous user-input branch for (views of) graph
  inputs removes the race.  Host-resident weights are not graph inputs, so the expert-upload
  async/staged path is unchanged.
* **Rebase:** the block-06 diff amended on the r34 chain; blocks 07-15 rebased onto it (bodies
  unchanged, only the `From <sha>` lines move).  Only `patches/0006` and `rdna-boosts-all.patch` change
  in content, plus `release.json`.
* **Validation (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14).**  Clean `-j16` build.  Output-preserving: 4B `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0`
  `-sm tensor` `-n 64` = `7386359e5dac` with the variable unset (the new default) and `=0`; 35B-A3B
  `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Q8_0` `-sm layer` `-n 48` = `cf7f8b23f404` (run on a free GPU with `-ncmoe 40`,
  output-invariant).  `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` 929/929.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green:
  strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree `d08fbaf2ca842ea3c3ce044ac45c0a8d0f11c597`, canonical tip
  `b01620f2d`.

## 2026-10-04 (r34) - release: the issues #59/#60 gfx1100 fix folded into block 15

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r34`** (canonical tip `33a8c30db9501469930bcd9eb3a77f25eec09647`, tree
`3c07e1f6e303efa59a92d0d63d2acf5e30666cb2`; `validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied
tree == `release.json.tree`).  Only **block 15** changes in content.  This promotes the
`archive/work/issues-59-60` candidate (built on r27, verified on gfx1100) onto `main` = r33, per the
maintainer's request, **before the reporter's external 196K confirmation returned** - the same
open item the candidate's README records.

* **#59 (closed): qsa3 off on RDNA3_0 by default.**  `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_qsa3_supported` now returns
  false on RDNA3_0 unless `GGML_CUDA_QSA3=1`; `=0` disables the path everywhere.  A packed QSA op's
  support equals the qsa3 predicate, and the qwen4exp graph probes the packed op through
  `ggml_backend_dev_supports_op` (`qsa3_op_supported`), so on gfx1100 the two natural-F16 K/V packs are
  no longer materialised (the reporter's r17+qsa3-off headroom).  RDNA3_5/RDNA4 defaults unchanged.
* **#60: geometry-aware fused-vs-chain QSA prefill score.**  The 4-head lightning-indexer op is
  supported on RDNA3_0 again and the fused-vs-chain choice moves into `build_qsa_top_k`'s `use_wmma`:
  auto takes the fused op once the score exceeds `LLAMA_QSA_SCORE_WMMA_MB` MiB (**default 64**, `0` =
  always fused) and keeps the faster chain below it.  On the reporter's `r=4` geometry 64 MiB is
  `n_kv` about 64K, so d30K/d64K keep the chain and the deep end leaves room for the 196K prefill.
  The unfused chain's `mul_mat+relu` and chunked `mul_mat+relu` now use `ggml_relu_inplace`, removing
  the chain's 2x-score reserve peak (bit-identical).  `LLAMA_QSA_SCORE_WMMA=0/1` forces chain/fused.
* **FA prefill staging arena accounting.**  `llama_get_memory_breakdown` (and therefore `--fit`) now
  includes the native-FA staging arena, bounded by `min(2*GGML_CUDA_FA_STAGE_MAX_MB, F16 attention-KV
  size)`, so it no longer under-provisions a deep prefill (issue #33 follow-up).
* **Rebase:** the candidate diff (8 files) applied to the r33 block-15 tree with **no conflicts**; the
  r28-r33 block-06/block-15 work does not overlap its anchors.  Only `patches/0015` and
  `rdna-boosts-all.patch` change (blocks 00-14 are byte-identical), plus `release.json`.
* **Candidate verification (gfx1100, ROCm 7.14, r27 base):** clean build; `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 23/23
  (26/26 with `GGML_CUDA_QSA3=1`), `LIGHTNING_INDEXER` 225/225, `TOPK_QSA` 4/4, `FLASH_ATTN_EXT`

## 2026-10-04 (r33) - release: block-06 A/B candidate for the async graph-input H2D race (issue #87, default off)

**`v16-84e76d8a2-r33`** amends **block 06** with a default-**off** A/B candidate for issue #87 (the
`HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_APERTURE_VIOLATION` in `k_get_rows_float` on the second request to a reused
MTP slot).  The reporter's hypothesis - a stale/racing upload of the recurrent-state copy `s_copy` - is
confirmed reachable: the r26 op-offload H2D path (block 06, `ggml_backend_sched_compute_splits`)
enqueues the split-input copy with `ggml_backend_tensor_set_async` straight from the host pointer, and
the recurrent state is always consumed through views (`rs_s_copy` -> `s_copy_main` / `s_copy_extra`).
`ggml_view_*` does not propagate `GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_INPUT`, so the views miss the synchronous user-input
branch and take the async one; the host overwrites `rs_s_copy` in `set_input()` on the next ubatch, so
the in-flight copy can read the next ubatch's value, a torn one, or race a reused split buffer.
Instrumented on gfx1201, the async path fires for exactly these tensors: `6 rs_s_copy (view) (4 bytes)
-> ROCm0#rs_s_copy (view)#0` plus the 0-byte extra.

**The fix (default off).**  `GGML_SCHED_SYNC_GRAPH_INPUTS=1` makes the copy loop resolve the view chain
with `ggml_backend_sched_graph_input()` and take the synchronous user-input branch for any split input
that is (a view of) a graph input.  Host-resident **weights** are not graph inputs, so the r26
expert-upload async/staged path is unchanged.  Unset keeps the r26 behaviour, so the two can be A/B
tested.  If the reporter confirms the crash is fixed, the default flips to on.

**I could not reproduce the reporter's OOB here** (llama-server, qwen35 Swift-1.5-Q4_K_M, the exact
flags including `--jinja --reasoning-preserve --spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive,ngram-mod`, two ~130k/148k
chat requests on a reused slot): `n_rs=1`, `n_seqs=1` at every graph build and no fault.  The link from
the confirmed race to the reporter's out-of-range gather is therefore not proven, but the race is real
and matches their analysis.  The default stays off until they confirm.

**Validation (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14).**  Clean `-j16` build, warning-free.  Output-preserving both ways:
4B `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` `-sm tensor` `-n 64` = `7386359e5dac` with the variable unset and `=1`, and 35B-A3B
`Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Q8_0` `-sm layer` `-n 48` = `cf7f8b23f404` with `=1` (both equal to r32).
`test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` 929/929 with `=1`.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: strict 16/16
`git am`, applied tree `14444e869d75871514d2aa99924264386014d55a`, canonical tip `13a3b1353`.

**Files.**  Block 06 (`ggml/src/ggml-backend.cpp`) is amended; blocks 07-15 are rebased onto it (their
bodies are unchanged, only the `From <sha>` lines move).  `release.json` regenerated.  The reporter
tests with `GGML_SCHED_SYNC_GRAPH_INPUTS=0/1`; the response is posted on issue #87.

## 2026-10-04 (r32) - release: four contributor PRs folded into block 15

**`v16-84e76d8a2-r32`** accepts PRs #78, #81, #83 and #84 and folds their code into **block 15** (the
last delivery block and the established home for late kernel wins, which already carries #68/#73/#74/#75).
The four `wip/` records are merged on `main`; no other block changed.

- **PR #78 (briansp2020, `wip/rdna4-dispatch-stall`)** - RDNA4 mmvq workaround for a gfx1201 grid-size
  dispatch stall. A launch at certain grid sizes costs a fixed ~8 us on gfx1201 (the total wave count near
  multiples of 2048; standalone HIP repro ROCm/TheRock#8634). Single-token dense decode for Q4_K/Q5_K/
  Q6_K/IQ4_XS walks its rows with a balanced grid capped at 1792 blocks when the launch would exceed it,
  and the per-type rows-per-block sweep keeps the #75 two-row win where it is real. Verify (Q8_0 short-K
  8-warp blocks) takes 2 rows at 4..8 tokens. Bit-exact; 27B `tg128` +1.2%.
- **PR #83 (briansp2020, `wip/rdna4-gsq-rco-kernels`)** - RDNA4 kernels for the ISTA-DASLab GSQ-RCO
  mixes, applied on top of #78. BF16 `mul_mat_vec_f` gets `#pragma unroll 4` and a `mul_mat_vec_f_vb`
  warp-per-row short-row kernel; IQ2_S/IQ3_S use the `apply_ksigns` sign decode; IQ3_S/IQ2_S join #78's
  row loop; and IQ2_XXS/IQ2_S/Q2_0 take the RDNA4 routed-compact MoE mmq. Bit-exact; GSQ IQ3_XXS GPU
  decode -17.4% / verify -10.7% / prefill -8.1%.
- **PR #84 (briansp2020, `wip/x86-q2_0-avx2`)** - an AVX2 `ggml_vec_dot_q2_0_q8_0` for x86 (which only
  had the scalar generic one), bit-identical to the generic code (explicit separate multiply/add so GCC
  does not contract). GSQ IQ3_XXS `-ncmoe 24` decode ~27 -> ~36 t/s.
- **PR #81 (overdoingism, `archive/work/issue80`, issue #80)** - an exact top-k fast path in
  `common_sampler_sample()` that hands only the k largest tokens to the chain when the samplers ahead of
  top-k are no-ops (penalties/DRY/top-n-sigma disabled; logit bias handled by the fast path) and the top
  k+1 logits are distinct, plus a `common_sampler_clone` that does not copy the 3 MB candidate array.
  Default on; `GGML_LF_FAST_TOPK=0` disables. Host sampling 1.0 -> 0.45 ms/step, clone 0.29 -> 0.01
  ms/step.

### Integration note: PR #78 needed a one-hunk rebase

The PRs were cut against r28, and r29-r31 changed `mmvq.cu` (the MoE cache's slot lookup). PR #78's hunk
that adds the `nrows_loop` parameter to `mul_mat_vec_q_switch_fusion_ksplit` has a context identical to
the earlier `mul_mat_vec_q_switch_fusion` (both share the argument list and the `has_fusion`
continuation), so `git am` applied the signature to the wrong function and the build failed with `use of
undeclared identifier 'nrows_loop'`. The fold moves the parameter to the ksplit function. This is the
only non-mechanical adjustment; every other hunk applied as authored.

### Validation (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14, combined r31 + four PRs)

- Clean `-j16` build warning-free; the AVX2 q2_0 path is active (`vpshufb` in `ggml_vec_dot_q2_0_q8_0`,
  no call to the generic).
- `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` **929/929**, `-o MUL_MAT` **1297/1297**; CPU `-b CPU -o MUL_MAT`
  **1323/1323** (80 `q2_0` cases). The new types are covered: iq2_s 14/4, iq3_s 14/12, iq2_xxs 79/75,
  q2_0 80/75, bf16 151/7 (MUL_MAT / MUL_MAT_ID).
- Coherence byte-identical to the r31 build: 4B `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` `-sm tensor` `-n 64`
  `7386359e5dac`, and 35B-A3B `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Q8_0` `-sm layer` `-n 48` `cf7f8b23f404`.
- Sampling fast path output-identical: 4B `--temp 0.7 --top-k 40 -n 300` gives `c118179c57ec` both with
  the default and with `GGML_LF_FAST_TOPK=0`.
- `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: 16/16 checksums, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree ==
  `release.json.tree` (`b090750760c58cc4c2271cbf4d260fe0413c52a3`, tip `9d46b0966`).

**Files.** The code rides in `patches/0015`; `release.json` is regenerated; the `wip/` records for
#78/#81/#83/#84 are accepted on `main`.

## 2026-10-03 - issue #67 closed: the residual cross-start flip is hipBLASLt solution selection

Issue [#67](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/issues/67) (the cross-start Q6_K greedy flip
on Windows / ROCm 10, from #58 item D) is **closed as an external ROCm issue**.  The r25 rope-fusion
bit-transparency fix was real (and stays shipped), but it did not remove the reporter's residual
per-start flip.  The remaining flip was then traced to **hipBLASLt solution selection**, not ggml:

- The F32 `mul_mat` for `ssm_alpha`/`ssm_beta` (5120 -> 48) at 512 prefill columns does not reach the
  mmvf/mmf kernels and goes to `hipblasSgemm`; rocBLAS routes it to hipBLASLt (`rocblaslt_matmul`,
  T,N, m=48 n=512 k=5120).
- `HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK=160` shows a per-process pick between a bit-identical reference solution pair
  (`140231`/`140232`) and a deviating pair (`140216`/`140217`), so layer 0's prefill output, and with it
  the whole run, differs at startup.  It reproduces on stock upstream master with none of the rdna-boosts
  patches.
- This is [ROCm/rocm-libraries#12126](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/issues/12126).  Workaround:
  `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0` (reporter's box: default 5/150 fresh starts deviate, the workaround 0/150;
  within noise on prefill/decode; prefill-only, since decode at n=1 uses mmvf).  Linux / ROCm 7.14 does
  not reproduce it.

**Docs only** - no delivery patch changes.  The record is in `README.md` ("Cross-start determinism on
ROCm (issue #67)"), `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §41, and the r25 notes in `patches/README.md`, `MANIFESTS.md`,
`BASELINE.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

## 2026-10-03 (r31) - release: two MMQ `MUL_MAT_ID` tail over-read holes in the host-resident path

**`v16-84e76d8a2-r31`** fixes the host-resident-expert corruption properly, and demotes the gather (whose
"win" was that corruption).  Full record: `archive/work/moe-mmq-overread/RESOLUTION.md`.

The quantized `MUL_MAT_ID` MMQ loader reads a full K tile and does not clamp the fast path's read to the
row, so the last row of an expert over-reads into the **head of the next slot** (`NaN * 0 = NaN` poisons
the tile -> repeated `/`).  The host copy path covers this (`copy_experts` copies
`+ min(expert_size, 512)` bytes); two pruned/partial device buffers did not.

**Hole A - the decode-cache arena (block 13, `moe-expert-cache.cu`).**  `alloc_table_locked` did
`cudaMalloc(arena_slots * expert_bytes)` with **no zero and no tail pad**; an empty slot's head was
uninitialized (NaN) memory and the bytes past the last slot were out of the allocation.  The r30
one-time zero guarded only the *gather* destination, never the arena - this is the corruption an aborted
stream exposed (persistent for the process, because the arena lives on).  **Fix:** allocate
`arena_slots*expert_bytes + min(expert_bytes,512)` and `cudaMemset` it once.  Verified live (long prompt
-> abort reasoning mid-stream -> subsequent prompts, multiple interruptions, 0 `/`).

**Hole B - the gather destination (block 06, `ggml-backend.cpp`).**  The gather's one-time head zero is
keyed on `(input_cpy->data, expert_bytes)` and never re-arms; the graph allocator re-uses the region
between ubatches, so the zero does not survive a **multi-ubatch prefill**, NaN routing skips expert work,
and the gather benchmarked 2-4x fast.  **Fix:** `sched->devgather_enabled` now defaults to **false** (the
staging / host-copy path copies the guard pad every pass into a backend-owned ring); `GGML_SCHED_DEVGATHER=1`
re-enables it for A/B only.  The arena fix does not move the gather number (2683 vs 657), so the two holes
are independent - both fixes are needed.

**Evidence** (qwen4exp IQ4_NL, 1 R9700, `-sm layer -ncmoe 48 -fa 1 --lazy-mode off --load-mode none -t 8
-p 8192 -n 0 -ub 2048`, `MIB=12288`): staging/default **657**; gather on **2683** (pre-r31 r30: 2674);
both with the arena already fixed for the 2683 figure.  PCIe sanity: the prefill reads ~68 GB from host
RAM per ubatch, so 2683-3086 t/s at `-ub 8192` needs ~25 GB/s (above this box's link) while 1396 needs
~11.6 GB/s - the gather was doing less work.

**Re-established baseline (default = staging).**  qwen4exp IQ4_NL (100 GB), 1 R9700, `MIB=12288`:
**pp8192 659 / 1018 / 1396** and **tg1024 39.7 / 40.3 / 35.9** at `-ub 2048/4096/8192`.  2-GPU
`-sm tensor -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 MIB=8192 -ub 2048 -p 1024`: **pp1024 562**.  (The docs' old "staging
657-1403" reproduces exactly.)  **Scope:** both holes need a *partial* expert buffer, so `-ncmoe 0` /
device-resident MoE is unaffected - there `MUL_MAT_ID` reads the model tensor directly and the tail
over-read is covered by the backend's zeroed allocation padding (`ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_init_tensor`).

**Follow-ups:** re-baseline on PCIe 5.0 x16 (two cards will be removed); then attack the real gap to
vLLM's ~3500 t/s; re-evaluate the gather once its destination is persistent/never-reused and the
`-sm tensor` redirect is fixed; and widen `gate-qwen4exp-quant-coherence.sh` with a multi-ubatch /
post-abort case plus a bandwidth-plausibility assertion.


## 2026-10-02 (r30) - release: block-13 amendment - the expert gather's head pad must match the host path

**`v16-84e76d8a2-r30`** amends **block 13** (`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/moe-expert-cache.cu`) with the fix for the
**repeated-`/` incoherence** that shipped in r29.  Also in this release: the campaign's `COMMUNITY-CONFIG.md`
moves to the repo root, the rest of `wip/moe-expert-cache/` moves to `archive/work/moe-expert-cache/`, and
the new per-quant regression gate lives at `scripts/gate-qwen4exp-quant-coherence.sh`.

### The bug

The host-resident-expert **device gather** copies only the routed experts, so the quantized `MUL_MAT_ID`
MMQ's speculative read past a routed expert can land in the reused `input_cpy`'s stale (NaN) bytes and
poison the tile (`NaN * 0 = NaN`) -> the model emits a repeated `/`.  The guard is a one-time zero of each
expert slot's head.  The scheduler's host upload path (`copy_experts`) guards with `min(expert_size, 512)`;
the gather hard-coded **64**.  64 is the *IQ4_NL* threshold the beta5 session measured - it is not a
quant-independent constant.  **IQ4_XS over-reads further**, so it corrupted; the beta5 gate set only used
IQ4_NL / Q8_0 / Q4_K_M, so r29 shipped the regression.

It is **not** a multi-GPU bug: reproduced on 1 GPU `-sm layer`, 2 GPU `-sm layer`, and 2/3 GPU `-sm tensor`,
with `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB` armed *and* unset (the gather is the always-on half), at `-ncmoe 20/48`,
`-b/-ub 2048/4096`, and every KV type.  `GGML_SCHED_DEVGATHER=0` suppresses it.  The reported config was a
2-GPU `-sm tensor` `llama-server` on qwen4exp IQ4_XS.

### The fix (block 13, +21/-16)

1. `head_pad = min(expert_bytes, 512)` - the host path's own guard value.  The zero is one-time, so the
   size is free: `pp8192` 3439.15 (r29) -> 3438.81 (r30) t/s on the reporter's config (noise).
2. The one-time zero is keyed on `(input_cpy buffer, expert_bytes)`, not the buffer pointer alone.  The
   graph allocator reuses one `input_cpy` across tables whose per-expert geometry differs (gate/up/down),
   and a zero laid at one stride does not cover another's slots.

### Validation (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14.1)

* **Reporter's exact server env** (`HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2 MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=8192
  MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_DEVMAP=1 GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=ce`, 2-GPU `-sm tensor --n-cpu-moe 20 -b/-ub 4096`, q8_0 KV,
  IQ4_XS + MTP): before -> `reasoning_content` = 2000 `/` (500 `////`); after -> 6302 chars, **0 `////`**,
  fluent through the requested HTML/Three.js answer.
* **New gate** `scripts/gate-qwen4exp-quant-coherence.sh` (per quant, gather ON + OFF, 2-GPU tensor): every
  qwen4exp quant is coherent (0 `////`) and transparent - IQ3_XXS `e4668ba88383`, IQ4_NL `22c9ef68893b`,
  IQ4_XS `762d57e89580`, Q4_K_M `3b8829d119e4` (ON == OFF).  On the r29 build the IQ4_XS ON run emits 4
  `////`, so the gate **hard-fails** it.  The `////` check is the hard gate; a hash mismatch is a WARN by
  default (qwen4exp `-sm tensor` has a rare run-to-run nondeterminism at temp 0) and `STRICT=1` makes it
  a hard failure.
* **Documented byte-identity gates still green**: 2-GPU `-sm tensor -ncmoe 0` = cache-on
  `-ncmoe 99 MIB=8192` = **`de8be4d0c90c`**; 1-GPU `-sm layer -ncmoe 99` = **`15038c19ddc8`**.
* `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` OK; warning-free clean build.
* `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: 16/16 checksums, strict 16/16 `git am` on a fresh `84e76d8a2` tarball,
  applied tree == `release.json.tree` (`0fe48395051775079fb18041142e3f22dbf82a72`).  New tip
  `6bba985363599e8dd92290ca32a1fb15876bbaf2`.

### Corrections to the r29 record

* The r29 note says the release tree is "byte-identical to the validated `beta5-clean` tree".  That is
  inexact: the fold tree is `beta5-clean` **minus the diagnostic strip** (521 lines, default-path
  behaviour-neutral).  The bug was in both.
* The `head_pad` comment in the r29 tree claimed "the correctness threshold is exactly 64 bytes".  That was
  measured on IQ4_NL only; the host path's `min(expert_size, 512)` is the real contract.

### Move

* `COMMUNITY-CONFIG.md` -> repo root; the `README.md` / `patches/README.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `BASELINE.md` /
  `MANIFESTS.md` / `WORKLOG.md` references are updated.
* `wip/moe-expert-cache/` -> `archive/work/moe-expert-cache/` (the campaign is complete).  The regression
  gate is delivery QA, not WIP, so it is now `scripts/gate-qwen4exp-quant-coherence.sh`.

## 2026-10-01 (r29) - release: the decode-side MoE expert cache is in the delivery (PR #82)

**`v16-84e76d8a2-r29`** releases the `promote-moe-caching` beta (the beta1-beta5 entries below, dated
2026-10-02 in those sessions) after PR #82 merged the branch to `main`.  The release commit changes only
the `release.json` label (`v16-84e76d8a2-r28-moe-cache-beta5` -> `v16-84e76d8a2-r29`) and the docs
headers; **no patch byte changed** (all 16 patch sha256s and `rdna-boosts-all.patch` are unchanged from
the beta5 regeneration).

- Canonical 16-block chain: fork point `84e76d8a2` (base tree `5112eedbce…`), tip
  `8e16c882ad8ebe6d7f3498e5940758f2d8802611`, net tree `65276106fc5a6f62e1d81f4975c4816012ea4fc4`
  (byte-identical to the `beta5-clean` tree that passed the full runtime gate set).
- What ships: blocks 06 (generic backend expert-cache interface + scheduler half), 13
  (`moe-expert-cache.{cu,h}` engine + `mmvq.cu` slot lookup), 14 (the gemma4 `-sm tensor` guard), 15 (the
  CUDA consumer glue).  The cache is **opt-in** (`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=<MiB>`; unset = inert and
  bit-identical to r28); the always-on half is the model-aware expert gather (`>= 224 MiB` tables gather
  the used experts instead of staging the whole shard) and the decode-band gate on the routed-expert
  rebalance.  **gemma4 `-sm tensor` is now rejected** (use `-sm layer`) until the segmented
  host-resident-expert async upload lands.  The user-facing sizing guide and measured tables live in
  `COMMUNITY-CONFIG.md` (referenced from the top-level `README.md`).
- Release-time gates: `scripts/validate-set.sh` **green** — artifact checksums (16/16 patches +
  `rdna-boosts-all.patch`), strict 16/16 `git am` on a fresh `84e76d8a2` codeload tarball, base tree ==
  `release.json.base_tree` (`5112eedb…`), applied tree == `release.json.tree` (`65276106f…`),
  Windows-checkout-safe paths.  The runtime gates (warning-free build, `MUL_MAT_ID` 929/929, byte-identity
  `de8be4d0c90c` / `15038c19ddc8`, width purity `none == n1 == n3 == n7`, MTP `n3` 0.75273, deep
  coherence, prefill A/B vs r28) carry over from the beta5 record because the tree is byte-identical to
  `beta5-clean`.
- Tag `v16-84e76d8a2-r29` on this commit; the tag push runs the GHCR image matrix and cuts the GitHub
  Release (see `CONTAINERS.md` for the pipeline).

## 2026-10-02 (moe-cache beta5 fold) - beta5 folded into the 16 blocks; `release.json` regenerated

**Branch `promote-moe-caching`**, release label **`v16-84e76d8a2-r28-moe-cache-beta5`** (still a beta:
no tag, no GHCR image, no merge to `main` yet).  Canonical chain in `~/llama-fold` branch
**`beta5-fold`**, tip **`8e16c882ad8ebe6d7f3498e5940758f2d8802611`**, net tree
**`65276106fc5a6f62e1d81f4975c4816012ea4fc4`** (== the `beta5-clean` tree, byte-for-byte).

The two `beta5-clean` file deltas were folded into the block that owns each file:

| beta5 delta | block | method |
|---|---|---|
| `ggml-backend.cpp` model-aware gather gate | **06** | `git apply --3way` at a rebase `edit` stop |
| `moe-expert-cache.cu` zero-before-gather + registration | **13** | same |

Blocks 07-15 replayed cleanly (their `ggml-backend.cpp` hunks - block 14's scheduler backend-choice
guards, block 15's instrumentation - do not overlap the gate hunks), and the folded tip tree is
identical to `beta5-clean`.  Regenerated with
`scripts/make-patches.sh ~/llama-fold 84e76d8a2 8e16c882a` then
`scripts/make-release.sh --base 84e76d8a2 --base-tree 5112eedb… --tip 8e16c882a… --tree 65276106f…
--release v16-84e76d8a2-r28-moe-cache-beta5`.

**Verification:** `scripts/validate-set.sh` green - artifact checksums, **strict 16/16 `git am`** on a
fresh `84e76d8a2` codeload tarball, applied tree == `release.json.tree` (`65276106f…`).  The folded
tree is byte-identical to the beta5-clean tree that passed the full gate set (MUL_MAT_ID 929/929,
byte-identity `de8be4d0c90c`/`15038c19ddc8`, width purity, MTP 0.75273, Q4_K_M matrix, 128K q8_0
coherence), so those results carry over.

**Cleanup done (this revision):** the fold also removes the r16/beta2 leftover env-gated debug/A-B
instrumentation from `ggml-backend.cpp`, `ggml-backend-meta.cpp` and `ggml-cuda.cu` - all 25 knobs
(`GGML_META_*` ×22, `GGML_SCHED_SYNCDBG`, `GGML_SET_BYTES`), their `TEMP INSTRUMENT` blocks and the
`g_ss_*`/`g_ring_*`/`g_meta_gc_*`/`g_gather_*`/`g_h2d_*`/pool timers they powered (521 lines), with
the defaults hard-coded.  Behaviour is unchanged on every default path: warning-free build, MUL_MAT_ID
929/929, byte-identity `de8be4d0c90c`/`15038c19ddc8`, width purity, MTP 0.75273.  Functional delivery
kill-switches (`GGML_CUDA_SPLICE_GATHER`, `GGML_CUDA_GCDBG`, `GGML_SCHED_STAGE*`, ...) are kept.

## 2026-10-02 (moe-cache beta5 validation) - byte-identity root cause, PLE warm-up confound, model-aware gather gate

**Branch `promote-moe-caching`** (this record), beta5 code on `~/llama-fold` branch **`beta5-clean`**
(based on `21de1b20b`), patch `archive/work/moe-expert-cache/beta5-clean-gates-and-reorder.patch`, built and
validated in `/tmp/reorg` (`build-rocm-b3`, gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14.1).  Still **not a release**.

### 1. Byte-identity regression - root-caused and fixed (block 13)

The WIP one-time expert-head zero was launched **after** `moe_cache_gather_kernel`, so on each
`input_cpy` buffer's first gather it zeroed the first 64 bytes of the routed experts the gather had
just written - corrupting the tile.  That is why 2-GPU `-sm tensor` cache-on (`15038c19ddc8`) did not
match the `-ncmoe 0` oracle (`de8be4d0c90c`) while gather-off did.  **Fix: launch the zero before the
gather**; the gather then overwrites the routed slots with real data and only non-routed heads keep the
zero.  Both splits now reproduce their oracles:

| gate | oracle | cache-on (gather) |
|---|---|---|
| 2-GPU `-sm tensor` (`-ncmoe 0`) | `de8be4d0c90c` | **`de8be4d0c90c`** |
| 1-GPU `-sm layer` (`-ncmoe 0`) | `15038c19ddc8` | **`15038c19ddc8`** |
| width purity `none == n1 == n3 == n7` (1-GPU layer) | - | **`15038c19ddc8`** |

A host-reading *fill* variant was also tested: it also restores byte-identity but reads every expert
slot's head from the (lazy) host master and costs **~3x prefill** (620 vs ~1900 t/s at `-p 8192`), so
it is not the fix.  A bare `de8be4d0c90c` also comes back with the host pad disabled, confirming the
over-read tail is not load-bearing - the zero order was the whole bug.

### 2. The qwen4exp prefill "regression" was the PLE mmap warm-up - not a regression

All qwen4exp prefill numbers in the r16 / item-3 / beta4 campaigns were measured with the default
`--lazy-mode auto`, where `per_layer_token_embd.weight` (**27465 MiB**) is mmap-lazy and its OS page
cache warms progressively.  The handover's beta5 `pp 2401` is that warmed steady state; a fresh run
reads ~1600 and **climbs every repetition** (`-p 8192 -n 0 -r 16`: 1613 -> 1790).  Loading the PLE into
host RAM removes the confound and is faster and flat:

`--lazy-mode off --load-mode none`, 1 GPU, `-ncmoe 48 -sm layer MIB=12288`, `-p 8192 -n 0 -b2048 -ub2048`:

| | pp8192 |
|---|---:|
| `-lzm auto` (default, cold -> warm) | ~1600 -> 1790 |
| `-lzm off` (PLE in RAM) | **2652-2662, flat** |

**Consequence:** every prior qwen4exp prefill comparison (`-sm tensor` vs `-sm layer`, gather vs
staging, the r16 tensor-split record, the item-3 "adaptive gate is a no-op" conclusion and the beta4
width-gate decision) is **confounded** by the mmap warm-up and must be re-measured with `-lzm off` (or a
warm reader).  qwen35moe / Q4_K_M have no lazy tensor and are unaffected.

### 3. Gather-vs-staging: a large expert table is a permanent gather win (block 06)

Unconfounded (`-lzm off`) single-R9700 qwen4exp `-sm layer -p8192 -n0` sweep:

| ub | gather | staging |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 512 | 1406 | 1398 |
| 1024 | 2056 | 2050 |
| 2048 | 2646 | 657 |
| 4096 | 2957 | 1008 |
| 8192 | 3052 | 1403 |

and the same box at `ub8192`: Q8_0 (272 MiB table) gather 3595 vs staging 3552 (tie/win); Q4_K_M
(144 MiB) gather 4291 vs staging **5624** (staging +31 %).  So the beta4 width gate is right for
Q4_K_M but wrong for a large table.  `sched_input_gatherable` now defers a table **>= 224 MiB** to the
gather in both the ring and the meta `stage_input` hand-off; Q4_K_M keeps the width gate.  With no
config change: qwen4exp ub8192 **1403 -> 3065**; Q4_K_M ub8192 5639 (unchanged); qwen4exp ub2048
2646 (gather).

### 4. Gates (all green, gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14.1)

* `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` **929/929**.
* Byte-identity / width purity / MTP: see the table and `0.75273` (207/275, mean 3.25) - the beta4
  values reproduced exactly.
* Q4_K_M prefill matrix `pp8192 ub8192 -r 3`: tensor 0/40 7240/5268, layer 40 4519 (beta4 record
  7269/5257/4511) - unchanged.
* **qwen35moe Q8_0 single GPU - the headline target (the weights do not fit a 32 GiB card).**  The real
  assessment is **131072 context with a q8_0 KV cache** (`-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 -fa 1`,
  `llama-bench -p 8192 -n 1024 -d 131072`, `n_ctx = 140288`, `tg128k` = 1024-token decode at depth
  131072), `-b 4096 -ub 4096`:

  | `-ncmoe` | `MIB` | pp8192 | tg128k |
  |---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | 12 | 8192 | **967** | 39.3 |
  | 16 | 8192 | 919 | 53.3 |
  | **20** | **8192** | **884** | **57.1** |
  | 24 | 12288 | 843 | **57.7** |
  | 40 | 12288 | 732 | 48.7 |

  Arena beyond 8192 adds nothing at `-ncmoe 16-20`; `-ub 8192` trades deep decode for prefill
  (986 / 45.2); `-ncmoe 8` does not fit at 128K.  Recommended: `-ncmoe 20 MIB=8192` (884/57.1).
  **The shallow `-c 8192` f16 table (below) is not representative of this budget** - the small f16 KV
  leaves far more VRAM for the arena - and is kept only for comparison with older records:
  `-ub 2048` `-ncmoe 8/16` 2624/72.9 and 1740/80.0; `-ub 4096` `-ncmoe 12` 3122/79.9, `-ncmoe 16`
  2706/81.1, `-ncmoe 20` 2404/81.8, `-ncmoe 24` 2139/78.6, `-ncmoe 40` 1554/61.8 (`-ncmoe 8` OOMs at
  `-ub 4096`).  Gather ~= staging for Q8_0 at every width.
* Deep coherence: qwen4exp **rc=0, 8770 words, 13 `##` sections, 0 `////`**; qwen35moe Q8_0 `-ncmoe 16`
  **rc=0, 6793 words, 13 sections, 0 `////`**.
* **Deep coherence at the real target - 131072 ctx / q8_0 KV - PASS:** qwen35moe Q8_0, `-ncmoe 20
  MIB=8192 -fa 1 -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 -c 131072`, a ~110K-token reference prompt + the essay task,
  `-n 12000 --reasoning off`: **rc=0, 12 numbered sections + `## Conclusion`, 6253 words, 0 `////`**,
  fluent to the end, hash `ca4e4ea16767` (all 12 requested sections present).
* Strip: the three `GGML_META_GATHER_*` knobs, `moe_cache_gather_pad_kernel` + its launch, the own-head
  tail guard and the `pad`/`zero_fill` kernel params are gone (`grep GGML_META_GATHER` on
  `moe-expert-cache.cu` is empty); clean build **warning-free**.

### Follow-ups

* Re-run the r16 tensor-split and item-3 staging-vs-gather records with `-lzm off`; the "no static
  signal separates gather from staging" conclusion is only true for the confounded data.
* Promote the 224 MiB threshold to a bandwidth-scaled crossover if more models are measured.
* The community config guide (`COMMUNITY-CONFIG.md`) records the single-GPU
  oversized-Q8_0-MoE recipe and the `-lzm off` requirement for qwen4exp.

## 2026-10-02 (moe-cache beta5 WIP) - gather-path registration + one-time expert-head zero

**Branch `promote-moe-caching`**, release label **`v16-84e76d8a2-r28-moe-cache-beta5-wip`**, beta4 chain
plus `21de1b20b` on `~/llama-fold` `beta4` (patch:
`archive/work/moe-expert-cache/beta5-fix-registration-and-head-zero.patch`).  Still **not a release**.  Found by
running the single-R9700 "halo" config (`-b 2048 -ub 2048`, `-ncmoe 48 -sm layer`, MIB=12288) that the
campaign's ~1470 t/s prefill had regressed to ~600 while decode collapsed.

**Two independent bugs, both fixed, in `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/moe-expert-cache.cu`:**

1. **Decode collapse - the gather path never registered its table.**  `moe_cache_update_host` registered
a table, but `moe_cache_gather_host` (used for the whole prefill band) uploaded without registering.
A prefill registered only the layer that fell off the gather; the deferred arena sizing latched on those
3 tables; the other 47 layers got 0 slots and declined, so decode fell off the cache - and the partial
arena stood the cache-band fusions down globally, making it *slower* than uncached (8.54 vs 20 t/s).
*Fix:* one `moe_cache_table(...)` call in `moe_cache_gather_host`.

2. **Prefill regression - the session-18 MMQ tail pad (campaign `d76e18efd`).**  That pad writes
`min(expert_bytes,512)` bytes after every routed expert so the MMQ's speculative read past the last
expert sees valid bytes; it cost **~3x** in every form tried (in-kernel trailing copy, folded into the
last chunk, separate kernel, own-head pad, zeros vs host bytes).  It is not a stride change and not
bandwidth - **zeros fix it** (the over-read only needs finite bytes) and the correctness threshold is
exactly 64 bytes (48 corrupts, 64 is fine) while the perf cliff is ~54, so no per-gather pad value is
both fast and correct.  *Fix:* **zero the first 64 bytes of every expert slot ONCE per `input_cpy`**
(`moe_cache_gather_zero_heads_kernel`, tracked in `g_heads_zeroed`) - only non-routed heads rely on it,
since the gather overwrites routed heads with real data.

**Verified (single R9700, Qwen3.8-Flash-Next IQ4_NL, `-ncmoe 48 -sm layer -fa 1`, MIB=12288,
`-b 2048 -ub 2048`, gather on):** `-p 8192 -n 1024` in one process = **pp8192 2401 + tg1024 36.5**
(before: 641/8.5 or 648).  Coherence (`coherence-essay-prompt.txt`, `-n 8192 -c 16384`, `--reasoning
off`) = fluent, 0 `////`.  Code docs updated in the beta5 patch.  See
`archive/work/moe-expert-cache/HANDOVER-2026-10-01-single-gpu-qwen4exp-prefill-regression.md`.

**Follow-up:** widen the single-GPU Q4_K_M/campaign gates; choose gather vs staging per model (the
default gate sends qwen4exp to staging); strip the temporary `GGML_META_GATHER_*` A/B knobs; long-run
coherence (~6000 words) and the full admission gate set before promotion.

## 2026-10-02 (moe-cache beta4) - prefill-regression fix: width-gate the gather, decode-gate the rebalance

**Branch `promote-moe-caching`**, release label **`v16-84e76d8a2-r28-moe-cache-beta4`**, canonical tip
**`f2974528091dc9686141939a534e1c680bf2ad22`**, net tree
**`a4c8564963f9f16f760f3a4b1805516f323b8cab`** (beta3 + 21/-7 lines in `ggml/src/ggml-backend.cpp`,
block 06 only).  Still **not a release** (no tag, no GHCR image, no merge to `main`).

A prefill-performance verification of beta3 against `main` (r28, built from `60361cb9f`) found two
regressions in the campaign's always-on block-06 scheduler changes.  Both are fixed here.

### The verification (same box/session A/B)

`pp8192`, `-fa 1`, `-ub/-b 8192`, `-r 3`, gfx1201 (3x R9700), `llama-bench`:

| config | ncmoe | r28 (`main`) | beta3 | **beta4** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2gpu tensor | 0 | 7269 | 7255 | **7305** |
| 2gpu tensor | 16 | 6306 | 5344 | **6320** |
| 2gpu tensor | 32 | 5606 | 4380 | **5596** |
| 2gpu tensor | 40 | 5257 | 4023 | **5259** |
| 2gpu layer | 16 | 5512 | 4182 | **5551** |
| 2gpu layer | 40 | 4511 | 1997 | **4531** |
| 1gpu | 16 | 5593 | 4239 | **5611** |
| 1gpu | 40 | 5398 | 3122 | **5405** |

beta3 lost 15-56 % at every offloaded cell; beta4 matches or beats r28 everywhere.  The r16 record
(1x R9700, `-r 1`, 2026-09-27) is 3-8 % above r28 on most cells and ~10 % below on 2gpu-layer 40 --
that is the historical single-run drift, not a feature regression.  With the campaign neutralised
(beta3 `GGML_SCHED_DEVGATHER=0` and the rebalance disabled) the trees reproduce r28 within 1 %, so the
**r16 feature itself is intact**.

The MoE expert cache itself is verified separately: 1-GPU `-sm layer` `-ncmoe 99` `tg512`
39.7 -> **74.2** (`MIB=8192`) -> **81.2** (`MIB=16384`) t/s, 2-GPU `-sm tensor` 32.9 -> **78.6**, and
the README gather-gate checkpoint (`pp2048 -ub 512`, ~724) reproduces at **723.6**.

### Root causes and fix (block 06)

1. **The device gather ran above the staging width gate.**  `sched_stage_issue` only stages above
   `sched_stage_min_tokens` (the H2D-calibrated width gate, ~1536 tokens); below it staging is skipped
   and the gather wins (ub512 +17 %, ub1024 +19 %).  Above it whole-shard staging wins.  beta2's cleanup
   inverted the `stage_input` hand-off (the campaign's `sched_gather_first && gatherable` became
   `!sched_input_gatherable`), so the gather ran at *every* prefill width -- a loss the campaign's own
   A/B recorded (`Q4_K_M ub8192 staging 5283 vs gather 4035`).  Fix: `sched_input_gatherable` now
   returns true only below the gate, its callers (the ring exclusion and the copy-loop gather) consume
   it, and the meta `stage_input` hand-off always stages above the gate.  Below-gate gather wins kept.
2. **The routed-expert rebalance was ungated.**  It moves each host-weight `MUL_MAT_ID` from pass 1's
   all-on-device-0 assignment to the layer's owning device -- a decode/cache win, but under `-sm layer`
   it spread the 105 expert splits across both GPUs (105/0 -> 105/95) and broke the staging pipeline:
   -42 % on `-sm layer` ncmoe 40 ub8192 (4511 -> 2625).  Fix: the rebalance is skipped for prefill-width
   `MUL_MAT_ID` (`ne[2] > 8`); decode/verify keep it.

### Re-gate (all green, gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14)

* `scripts/validate-set.sh`: strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree == `a4c8564963f9f16f760f3a4b1805516f323b8cab`;
  clean build **warning-free**.
* Byte-identity: 2-GPU `-sm tensor` `-ncmoe 0` oracle == cache-on (`MIB=8192`) == **`de8be4d0c90c`**;
  width purity `none == n1 == n3 == n7 ==` **`15038c19ddc8`** (1-GPU `-sm layer`).
* `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` **929/929**; gather gate `pp2048 -ub 512` **723.6** (README ~724).
* Cache decode (unchanged): 1-GPU layer **39.7 -> 74.2 -> 81.2** t/s, 2-GPU tensor **32.9 -> 78.6**.
* MTP `n3` acceptance **0.75273**; deep coherence rc=0, **8116 words, 13 `##` sections, `## Conclusion`**.

The change is a scheduler path-selection fix (gather vs staging are bit-identical), so the arithmetic
gates are unchanged; the 4-hunk diff is recorded in block 06's message.

---

## 2026-10-02 (moe-cache beta3) - block re-org: scheduler/interface -> block 06, MoE engine -> block 13

**Branch `promote-moe-caching`**, release label **`v16-84e76d8a2-r28-moe-cache-beta3`**, canonical tip
**`5bbba5d64be7a711261df8c185c5e10150f7801c`**, net tree
**`0fe985fbe28085f6e57d29802a1a016f5bf82c4c`** (== beta2, byte-identical, so every beta2 / campaign
gate carries over unchanged).  Still **not a release** (no tag, no GHCR image, no merge to `main`).

The beta2 follow-up (the "reorg finding") is done.  The campaign content is redistributed to the blocks
whose code it extends:

| block | campaign content |
|---|---|
| **06** (general system-operations) | the generic iface (`moe_cache_update` / `_take_over` / `_promote` / `_gather`, `ggml-backend-impl.h`) and the four `NULL` field names in the CPU/RPC vtables; the scheduler half (`ggml-backend.cpp`: the routed-expert rebalance onto the layer's owning device, the merged per-layer MoE split, the device gather + staging deferral, the input takeover and its deferred promotion); the Meta delegation (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp`); and the `#define GGML_ENV_STR` cache macro. |
| **13** (fused MoE kernels) | the engine `moe-expert-cache.{cu,h}` and the in-kernel slot lookup in `mmvq.cu`. |
| **14** (qwen4exp / arch) | `llm_arch_supports_sm_tensor()` rejects `LLM_ARCH_GEMMA4` until the segmented host-resident-expert async upload is finished. |
| **15** (campaign memory wins) | the CUDA consumer glue that interleaves with block 15's own fusion/staging code: `ggml-cuda.cu` (cache-aware fused gate+up+GLU / down folds, `MUL_MAT_ID` takeover, the cache-band fusion stand-down, the iface assignment), `common.cuh` (the `h2d_pin`/`h2d_scratch` helpers the gather uses), and the `ggml-backend-meta.cpp` `stage_gather` return-value guard. |

### How the relocation was resolved (`git apply --3way` conflicts)

The chain was rebuilt from the r28 blocks, applying the cleaned campaign delta at the target block:

* `ggml-backend.cpp` at block 06: **one** conflict -- the campaign's `wait_before_overwrite` refactor
  replacing r28 block-15's `GGML_META_NOSYNC`-wrapped wait.  Resolved to the campaign form (the
  `GGML_META_NOSYNC` wrapper is stripped by the beta2 cleanup anyway); the `GGML_ENV_STR` macro was
  relocated from block 15 into block 06, where the campaign's `GGML_SCHED_DEVGATHER` gate uses it.
* `ggml-backend-meta.cpp` at block 06: **two** conflicts -- the `stage_input` `stage_gather` hunk (kept
  for block 15, whose r16 staging introduces `stage_gather`) and the meta iface initializer
  (`.graph_optimize` stays `nullptr` in block 06 and the four `moe_cache_*` fields are added; block 14
  later sets `.graph_optimize`).  The four `moe_cache_*` delegation functions are pure additions and
  apply cleanly.
* block 13 picks up `moe-expert-cache.{cu,h}` + `mmvq.cu` cleanly.  `ggml-cuda.cu`'s consumer hooks are
  interleaved with block-15 functions (`ggml_cuda_match_hc_mix`, the qwen4exp weighted-down chain,
  `ggml_cuda_cache_blocks_fusion`'s insertion site) and `common.cuh`'s 4-line change is a duplicate
  comment inside block 15's `h2d_scratch` block, so both stay in block 15 (a hunk-level split would move
  block-15 functions into block 13 and invert the block boundaries).  Block 15's tree is set to the
  target, so it carries exactly the remaining r28 + campaign content.
* `src/llama-arch.cpp` at block 14 applies cleanly.

**New chain tip `5bbba5d64`; the 16 block SHAs are** `d94fdf742 / bcfcd3b46 / b091df4f9 / fc9f64c97 /
f98727886 / 2569fa971 / 141fcfe69 / 8b39526ca / 8ee91ddf5 / cdd2a6b08 / 35f9b3daa / 06f7c0b19 /
313be1050 / 81f72f5d6 / 8301304ad / 5bbba5d64`.

### Admission gates (all green, gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14, 3x R9700)

* `scripts/validate-set.sh`: artifact checksums, **strict 16/16 `git am`**, applied tree ==
  `release.json.tree` (`0fe985fbe28085f6e57d29802a1a016f5bf82c4c`).
* Clean gfx1201 build (`~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714` config): **warning-free**, exit 0.
* `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` on ROCm0: **929/929**.
* **Byte-identity (transparency oracle).**  35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M, 2-GPU `-sm tensor`, `prompts/reasoning.txt`,
  seed 42 / temp 0 / `--ignore-eos` / 300 tok: `-ncmoe 0` oracle == cache-on
  (`-ncmoe 99 MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=8192`) == **`de8be4d0c90c`** (1397 chars).
* **Width purity.**  1-GPU `-sm layer`, cache on `MIB=8192`, `--spec-type none` == `draft-mtp
  --spec-draft-n-max 1` == `... 3` == `... 7` == **`15038c19ddc8`** (1392 chars).
* **MTP `n3`.**  1-GPU `-sm layer`, cache on `MIB=8192`, acceptance **0.75273** (207/275), mean len 3.25
  (> the ~0.45 floor).
* **Deep coherence.**  1-GPU `-sm layer`, cache on `MIB=8192`, `archive/work/moe-expert-cache/coherence-essay-prompt.txt`
  (sha256 `5e9a8ab0…`), `-n 12000 -c 16384 --spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3`: rc=0, **8116
  words, 13 `##` sections, `## Conclusion`**.

The net tree is byte-identical to beta2, so the campaign's full validation record (gfx1201 / gfx1151 /
gfx1100) carries over; the gates above are the reproduction on the reorged chain.

## 2026-10-02 (moe-cache beta2) - warning/knob cleanup + re-gated admission

**Branch `promote-moe-caching`**, release label **`v16-84e76d8a2-r28-moe-cache-beta2`**, canonical tip
**`0f77c32d1473147e811d445119e47ea28561be18`**, net tree
**`0fe985fbe28085f6e57d29802a1a016f5bf82c4c`**.  Still **not a release** (no tag, no GHCR image, no merge
to `main`).  This is the promotion-readiness pass over the beta1 fold (`ce06f7add`, tree `1922182…`).

**Why the tree is no longer byte-identical to the campaign tree.**  beta1 was deliberately kept
byte-identical to the campaign's validated tree and carried the campaign's bring-up/A-B instrumentation.
beta2 strips that instrumentation and fixes the warnings; the default path is behaviourally unchanged
(every stripped knob was default-off or default-value, and the gates below reproduce the campaign's
recorded hashes), so the validated campaign numbers carry over.

### Warning fixes

* The three warnings beta1 recorded are gone: the CPU routing profiler (`GGML_MOE_PROFILE`) is removed
  entirely (its `dst->name != NULL` tautology was the `-Wtautological-pointer-compare`), and the CPU and
  RPC backend iface vtables now name the four new `moe_cache_*` fields (NULL), so the backend build is
  warning-free again.

### Env-gated debug / A-B knobs stripped

* The CPU-computes-the-misses split (`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_CPUSPLIT`) is removed end to end: the iface drops
  `cpu_ids`/`cpu_gate`/`n_cpu`, `ggml_backend_sched_set_moe_cpu_split` and the scheduler registry go, the
  `build_moe_ffn` CPU branch goes, and the engine's partition/zero-slot/reserve machinery goes.  It was a
  documented negative result and opt-in.
* The scheduler debug/A-B instrumentation: `GGML_SCHED_INPUTDBG`, the campaign's `GGML_SCHED_SYNCDBG`
  input-loop timing splits, `GGML_SCHED_BUFTDBG`, the adaptive staging-vs-gather probe
  (`GGML_SCHED_STAGE_AUTO`, `GGML_SCHED_GATHER_FIRST`), the unsafe `GGML_META_NOSYNC`, and the
  `moe rebalance`/`moe hook` debug logs.
* The engine's `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_DEBUG` / `_VERIFY` / `_SELFTEST` / `_ASSERT` / `_ASSERT_SABOTAGE` /
  `_FAIL_ALLOC` / `_PROGRESS` / `_PROGRESS_MS` / `_TIMING` / `_SKIP_ROLE` / `_FORCE_COPY` /
  `_FORCE_DEVMAP` / `_NOEVICT` / `_ADMIT` / `_COLD` / `_WARMUP_TOKENS` / `_PREFILL_LOAD` / `_TABLES`
  knobs, and `GGML_META_SCRATCH_MB` / `GGML_META_GATHER_NOPAD` / `GGML_CUDA_CACHEDBG` /
  `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_LOG`.  The defaults are hard-coded (`COLD=uva`, `ADMIT=touch`, `REPORT=on`) and the
  `GGML_META_SCRATCH_MB` 256 MiB bound is restored.
* Kept (functional, default-on kill switches): `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB` (the arm), `_SLOTS`, `_PERIOD`,
  `_TOUCH`, `_FILL`, `_RESERVE_MIB`, `_DEVMAP`, `_DEVPOLICY`, `_KSLOT`, `_PREFILL_SEED`,
  `_PREFILL_SEED_N`, `_PROVISIONAL`.

### Admission gates (all green, gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14, 3x R9700)

* `scripts/validate-set.sh`: artifact checksums, **strict 16/16 `git am`** on a fresh `84e76d8a2`
  codeload tarball, applied tree **`0fe985fbe28085f6e57d29802a1a016f5bf82c4c`** == `release.json.tree`.
* Clean gfx1201 build (`~/.pi/.../build-llama-rocm-714` config, `-j16`): **warning-free**, exit 0.
* `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` on ROCm0: **929/929**.
* **Byte-identity (transparency oracle).**  35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M, 2-GPU `-sm tensor`, `prompts/reasoning.txt`,
  seed 42 / temp 0 / `--ignore-eos` / 300 tok: `-ncmoe 0` oracle == cache-on
  (`-ncmoe 99 MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=8192`) == **`de8be4d0c90c`** (1397 chars).
* **Width purity.**  1-GPU `-sm layer`, cache on `MIB=8192`, `--spec-type none` == `draft-mtp
  --spec-draft-n-max 1` == `... 3` == `... 7` == **`15038c19ddc8`** (1392 chars).
* **MTP `n3`.**  1-GPU `-sm layer`, cache on `MIB=8192`, acceptance **0.72917** (175/240), mean len 3.19
  (> the ~0.45 floor).
* **Deep coherence.**  1-GPU `-sm layer`, cache on `MIB=8192`, `archive/work/moe-expert-cache/coherence-essay-prompt.txt`
  (sha256 `5e9a8ab0…`), `-n 12000 -c 16384 --spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3`: rc=0, **8116
  words, 13 `##` sections, `## Conclusion`**.

### Reorg (scheduler/interface -> block 06, MoE kernels -> block 13)

**Completed in beta3 (see the entry above).**  beta2 investigated the move and parked it with the
exact `git apply --3way` conflict points; beta3 relocates `GGML_ENV_STR` into block 06 and completes
the re-partition with no change to the net tree.

## 2026-10-02 (moe-cache beta) - promote `wip/moe-expert-cache` into the 16-block set (BETA branch)

**Branch `promote-moe-caching`** (`origin` = `git@github.com:stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts.git`), release
label **`v16-84e76d8a2-r28-moe-cache-beta1`**, canonical fold tip
**`ce06f7add75ba02e11281f2e567ddd14b3f08c81`**, net tree
**`19221824972d040e4fc83dd245b4966919e1fa99`** (== the campaign tree).  **Not a release:** no tag, no GHCR
image, no merge to `main` -- this is the beta-test branch for the feature until it is merged.

The decode-side MoE expert cache campaign is folded into the existing **16 blocks** (no new block).  The
campaign was authored on the r28 delivery tip; its net diff is **12 files / +5436/-48**.  The fold is a
fresh linear rebuild from `84e76d8a2`: each block commit is cherry-picked and the campaign net diff is
appended to the block that owns it, resolved with `git apply -3` against the r28 blobs.  The final tree is
**byte-identical** to the campaign's validated tree, so every campaign gate (byte-identity to the `-ncmoe 0`
oracle, width purity `none == n1 == n3 == n7`, MTP acceptance, deep coherence, and the gfx1201 / gfx1151 /
gfx1100 records) carries over unchanged.

### Mapping (campaign file -> block)

| block | campaign content |
|---|---|
| **06** (general system-operations) | the generic backend expert-cache interface: `moe_cache_update` / `_take_over` / `_promote` / `_gather` (`ggml-backend-impl.h`) and `ggml_backend_sched_set_moe_cpu_split` (`ggml-backend.h`); plus the opt-in CPU MoE routing profiler `GGML_MOE_PROFILE` (`ggml-cpu.c`). |
| **14** (qwen4exp / arch) | `llm_arch_supports_sm_tensor()` rejects `LLM_ARCH_GEMMA4` until the segmented host-resident-expert async upload is finished. |
| **15** (campaign memory wins) | everything else: the new `moe-expert-cache.{cu,h}`, the CUDA consumers (`ggml-cuda.cu`, `mmvq.cu`), the scheduler hooks (`ggml-backend.cpp`), the Meta delegation (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp`), the bounded h2d scratch (`common.cuh`), and the opt-in CPU-computes-the-misses graph branch (`llama-graph.cpp`). |

Blocks 00-05 and 07-13 change only in their `From <sha>` / `index` lines (bodies unchanged).

**Why the bulk is in block 15 and not block 13 (MoE).**  The campaign's `ggml-cuda.cu`, `ggml-backend.cpp`
and `ggml-backend-meta.cpp` changes were authored against the r28 tree and use block-15 facilities
(`GGML_ENV_STR`, the r16 `stage_gather` chunk geometry, `h2d_scratch`, the HC fusion matcher).  Folding them
into block 06/13 would require inventing forward references to later-block code -- rejected by the
`archive/work/beta-integration` relocation rule.  Block 15 is the repo's established home for subsystem /
campaign folds (r16's prefill sibling is there too; the campaign's own note said its long-term home is
block 06).

### Verified on the fold

* `scripts/validate-set.sh` **green**: strict 16/16 `git am` on a fresh `84e76d8a2` codeload tarball, applied
  tree == `release.json.tree` (`19221824972d040e4fc83dd245b4966919e1fa99`).
* Clean `gfx1201` / ROCm 7.14 build (`~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714`) **exit 0**; `test-backend-ops -o
  MUL_MAT_ID` **929/929**.
* **Known beta issue**: the campaign adds three compiler warnings the r28 delivery did not have --
  `-Wmissing-field-initializers` for `moe_cache_update` in `ggml-cpu/ggml-cpu.cpp` and
  `ggml-rpc/ggml-rpc.cpp` (the new iface fields are not named in those vtables), and a tautological
  `dst->name != NULL` in the CPU routing profiler.  The tree is deliberately kept byte-identical to the
  validated campaign tree for the beta; fold the warning fixes in with the next amendment and re-run the
  gates.

## 2026-09-30 (r28) - block-15 amendment: the VMM pool free-order abort (issue #76)

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r28`** (canonical tip `60361cb9f90437f7070e6f6b04ab673c85af7ddd`, tree
`dc2decae2a6ec8c95562c0d9a2fe53eb1ac49b63`; `validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree ==
`release.json.tree`).  Only **block 15** changes in content.  The fix is PR #77 by **overdoingism** (reported
as issue #76); the PR itself only carried a `archive/work/issue76/` note and a standalone patch, so it is folded into
block 15 here (the home of the issue-#48 `kq_blocks` mask skip that introduced the ordering mismatch).

**Why.**  `ggml_cuda_pool_vmm` is a stack: `free()` decrements `pool_used` and asserts
`ptr == pool_addr + pool_used`, i.e. allocations must be freed in the reverse of their allocation order.
`ggml_cuda_pool_alloc` objects are destroyed in reverse *declaration* order, so a pool buffer must be
declared in the order it is allocated.  In `launch_fattn` (`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn-common.cuh`) the
allocations are `KV_max`, then `kq_blocks` (the derived or packed fully-masked-group bitmap, issue #48), then
`dst_tmp` / `dst_tmp_meta` -- but `kq_blocks` was declared *after* `dst_tmp`/`dst_tmp_meta`.  When the mask
skip is active and the batch also allocates `dst_tmp_meta` (fractional stream-k tiles, or
`parallel_blocks > 1`), the destructors run in the order `kq_blocks`, `dst_tmp_meta`, `dst_tmp`, `KV_max`;
`kq_blocks` is then not on top of the stack, so the assert fires immediately after prompt processing.  The
failure is prompt/shape-dependent (it needs `ntiles_dst % nblocks_total != 0`, or `parallel_blocks > 1`),
and the legacy pool (`GGML_HIP_NO_VMM=ON`, the HIP default) does not check the order, so it only aborts on a
VMM-enabled build.  The reported backtrace was
`ggml_cuda_pool_vmm::free` <- `launch_fattn<256, 32, 2>` <- `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_mma_f16_case<256, 256, 32, 2>`.
The reporter's workaround was `GGML_CUDA_FA_MASK_SKIP=0` (never allocate `kq_blocks`).

**Fix.**  Declare `kq_blocks` right after `KV_max`, before `dst_tmp`/`dst_tmp_meta`, so the declaration
order matches the allocation order (`KV_max`, `kq_blocks`, `dst_tmp`/`dst_tmp_meta`).  The change is a
declaration move only -- no computation, no validation, no argument changes -- so output is unchanged.

**Verified** (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14):

* **Reproduced, then fixed, with a `-DGGML_HIP_NO_VMM=OFF` build** (`VMM: yes` at device init; `build-rocm-vmm`).
  Pre-fix, `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` aborts on its **first** case in
  `ggml_cuda_pool_vmm::free` via `launch_fattn<64, 16, 4>` / `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_mma_f16_case<64, 64, 16, 4>`
  (`GGML_ASSERT(ptr == (void *) ((char *)(pool_addr) + pool_used)) failed`,
  `ggml-cuda.cu:718`).  Post-fix the same binary exits 0 with **6354/6354** FLASH_ATTN_EXT cases passed.  The
  reporter also confirms the aborting 32.5K-token Qwen3.8-27B Q5_K_M / q8_0 KV / ubatch 512 conversation
  (Windows and Linux R9700, ROCm 10) completes after the fix and aborts before it.
* **Output-preserving on the default (VMM off) build**: 4B `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` 3-GPU `-sm tensor`, f16 and q8_0
  KV, seed 42 / temp 0, same-seed text is byte-identical pre-fix vs post-fix (`96 chars sha=ea43b94ecff1`
  for both KV types via `scripts/extract-generated.py`).
* Clean `-j16` build of the whole tree is **warning-free**.
* `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree `dc2decae2a6ec8c95562c0d9a2fe53eb1ac49b63`.

**Files.**  The code change rides in `patches/0015`; `release.json` is regenerated (`tip`/`tree` above); PR
#77's `archive/work/issue76/` note is accepted on `main`.

## 2026-09-30 (r27) - block-15 amendment: four contributor PRs + the issue-#71 RDNA4 rows fix

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r27`** (canonical tip `7fe4fca497f8ef2c6e440d5405a95452cdd3c230`, tree
`7427f424fbd3b7e1b2fbf807d81a04fe43caf373`; `validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree ==
`release.json.tree`).  Only **block 15** changes in content.  This collects **PR #68**, **PR #73**, **PR #74**
and **PR #75** (all accepted into `main` as their own `wip/` directories) plus the self-contained fix in
**issue #71**, and folds every code change into block 15 (the last block), the low-risk home the r22/r23
amendments used so no earlier block patch has to be re-based.  Every change preserves output: the two
end-to-end gates and the 27B width probe reproduce **byte-identical** hashes against the r26 build.

### PR #68 (briansp2020) - dense SWIGLU folded into the mmq down-projection quantize

`wip/rdna4-dense-swiglu-mmq/`.  At prefill the FFN `silu(gate) * up` was a standalone
`unary_gated_op_kernel<op_silu>` write followed by a `quantize_mmq_q8_1` read-back (27B UD-Q4_K_XL
pp512: 64 GLU launches, ~6 ms of ~343 ms).  `quantize_mmq_q8_1` gains a `glu` template variant (every
DS layout, so Q4_K / Q5_K / Q6_K / IQ4_XS down projections qualify) that computes `silu(gate) * up` on
load with the same op and one multiply as the standalone kernel, and a `GLU(SWIGLU) -> MUL_MAT` matcher
fires only when the new `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_takes_mmq()` (the dispatcher's predicate chain, in the same
order) says the down projection would run through mmq - so decode and the verify band never reach it.
The block-13 MoE fold keeps its own path.  `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_SWIGLU_MMQ=0` turns it off.  Contributor
numbers: 63 of 64 FFN GLU launches gone, -4 ms of ~343 ms per ubatch; server prefill +1.2 % at 50k,
+0.8 % at 97k; `llama-bench pp2048` 1337 -> 1350; decode and every greedy text unchanged.

### PR #73 (overdoingism) - DFlash: keep the target's layer features on the device (issue #69)

`archive/work/issue69/`.  The DFlash drafter needs a few target layers' inputs, which r25 copied
device -> host -> device every target batch (up to ~52 MB per batch at `-b 2048`).  With
`GGML_LF_DFLASH_DEV=1` (single sequence only; `--parallel > 1` / multimodal falls back to the host path
with a note) the target copies them device-to-device into persistent per-layer `[n_embd, n_batch]`
buffers on the layer's own backend and the drafter gathers the rows it needs on the device
(`ggml_get_rows` per layer + `ggml_concat`) from `ctx_other`; a backend event makes the next target batch
wait for the drafter to finish reading.  It costs ~200 MB extra VRAM at `-b 2048`.  Contributor numbers:
prefill +19 % at 30k / +14 % at 100k, +8 % on a Windows box, identical greedy tokens and acceptance
counts.  **Kept opt-in**: the device buffer allocation is a hard `GGML_ASSERT` on failure, so a
nearly-full card aborts rather than falling back; the path is now validated here as output-identical and
faster (see below), but the missing fallback is what blocks a default flip.

### PR #74 (overdoingism) - ksplit mmvq verify epilogue: recursive-halving reduce (issue #70)

`archive/work/issue70/`.  Without fusion, `mul_mat_vec_q_ksplit` ran one full warp butterfly per output
(`ncols_dst * rows_per_cuda_block` of them; 8 x 4 = 32 butterflies / 160 lane exchanges).  The patch
reduces all outputs together by recursive halving (one-wave blocks only), 31 exchanges for 8 x 4, with
every output still summed by the same pairing tree (offsets 16, 8, ... 1, own value first) - so it is
bit-identical.  The halving steps are template-recursive, so every index stays compile-time.  The 8-wave
Q8_0 short-K block keeps the old epilogue (the gathering warp's serial halving was slower on small
grids).  Contributor numbers: Q5_K ksplit 8 cols -4.0 %, Q6_K 8 cols -3.2 %, Q5_K 4 cols -2.1 %, all
ksplit mmvq -3.7 % in a pp8 run; end-to-end decode +0.7 % at 30k and +1.0 % at 100k.

### PR #75 (briansp2020) - RDNA4 decode/prefill kernels from Flash-Next profiling

`wip/rdna4-flashnext-kernels/` (patch 0001; the optional `scripts/rdna4-bitcheck/` test tools of 0002 are
not folded in, they are development-only).  Two groups:

* **qwen4exp only:** the `HC_MIX` up projection gets a band kernel (one block per `RPB` rows serves every
token, reduction only over the warp's own rows, `GGML_CUDA_HC_MIX_BAND=0` off); the down tail quantizes
`v = silu(lo/hc)` once for the whole block that completes each q8_1 group instead of in every up block
(`GGML_CUDA_HC_MIX_PREQ=0` off); and `rms_gamma_quant` keeps `x`/`xn` in registers.  Up kernel 16.5 ->
9.1 us at 1 token and 59.7 -> 20.6 us at 5.
* **general (any model with these types/shapes):** RDNA4 one-token dense mmvq uses 2 rows per block
(`GGML_MMVQ_RDNA4_WEIGHT_RPB1`) instead of the table's one-row, one-warp block (Q5_K/Q6_K ~270 GB/s
cold); F32 `mul_mat_vec_f` unrolls the K loop 4x and does one cross-warp exchange for all columns at
nt > 1 (MoE routers 17.9 -> 9.8 us at 1 token); a cheaper IQ2/IQ3 sign-unpack (`apply_ksigns`); an
IQ2_XS `mul_mat_vec_q_moe` item-loop unroll; `#pragma unroll 1` in the mmq `q8_0_16` / `q8_1` vec dots
(J=16 / J<=64 spilled on gfx12; Q5_K 10240 at nt=64 189 -> 60 us); and IQ2_XS/IQ3_XXS take the
routed-compact MoE mmq path (IQ2_XS nt 512/2048 1674/2374 -> 1467/2224, IQ3_XXS 1355/1887 ->
869/1662 us).  Contributor GPU-kernel-time summary on Flash-Next: decode -10.8 %, 5-token verify
-17.4 %, pp2048 ubatch -3.8 %.

**Correction (gfx1151 scope).**  The IQ2_XS/IQ3_XXS routed-compact enablement is gated to **RDNA4** in
`mmq_rdna3_5_id_get_J` / `mmq_rdna3_5_id_use_compact` (both take an `rdna4` flag; the two call sites pass
`GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA4(cc)` and the static_asserts cover both values).  The compact bands came from the
gfx1151 source of record, which keeps its measured plain path for those two types; only gfx1201 re-measured
the compact win.  RDNA3_5 behaviour is therefore byte-for-byte the pre-r27 state.  (Also fixed: the
parenthesised `#pragma unroll (type == GGML_TYPE_IQ2_XS ? 2 : 1)` in `mul_mat_vec_q_moe` emitted a
`-Wcuda-compat` warning; it is unparenthesised now and the clean build is warning-free again.)

### Issue #71 (overdoingism) - RDNA4 multi-row mmvq with a multi-wave block

`calc_rows_per_block_weight()` ignored its `nwarps` argument on the RDNA4 branch and returned 4 rows for
Q8_0 short-K weights, while `calc_nwarps_weight()` gave that same weight an 8-wave block - the reported
shape (K = 2880, 8 tokens) was 21-41 % slower at every row count > 1.  The fix returns **1 row for
`ncols_dst >= 2 && nwarps > 1`**, so multi-row blocks are used only by one-wave blocks.  It is written to
compose with PR #75's new single-token `RPB1 == 2`: the early return is restricted to `ncols_dst >= 2`, so
the one-token gain (which PR #75 measured on exactly this Q8_0 short-K block) is preserved.  Reporter
numbers on gpt-oss-20b (MXFP4): `mul_mat_vec_q_ksplit<Q8_0, 8 cols>` 41.4 -> 32.3 us (-22 %), all ksplit
mmvq in a pp8 run 105.6 -> 91.8 ms (-13 %); `test-backend-ops` MUL_MAT + MUL_MAT_ID dump/compare was
bit-identical apart from the f32 x f32 BLAS run-to-run noise.

### Independently re-verified here (gfx1201, ROCm 7.14, 3x R9700)

* `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` **929/929**, `-o MUL_MAT` **1297/1297**, `-o HC_MIX` **20/20**,
  `-o GATED_DELTA_NET` **46/46**.
* 4B `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` `-sm tensor` coherence **`1c5d32ac537d`** and qwen4exp Flash-Next IQ4_NL
  single-card `359ff4337837` - both **identical to the r26 build** rebuilt in the same tree.
* 27B UD-Q4_K_XL q8_0 `test-logits-width-probe` at `P = 4000` (`RS=from_w`): every per-W hash, the
  row0/row1 hashes and `width_purity=PASS (worst maxdiff 0)` are **byte-identical to r26**, so the mmvq /
  mmq / SWIGLU->mmq changes are width-pure and output-preserving.
* Clean `-j16` build of the whole tree is **warning-free**.
* **DFlash device path validated post-release** (drafter supplied after the tag was cut: `Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2-Q4_K_M`, 27B UD-Q4_K_XL target, q8_0 KV, `--spec-type draft-dflash --spec-draft-n-max 3`, 5246-token prompt).
  `GGML_LF_DFLASH_DEV=0` (host path) and `=1` (device path) produce the **identical** greedy text
  (`487 chars sha=dad22c4270ab`), with the device path faster: prefill **1144.2 -> 1232.5 t/s** and
  generation 63.8 -> 65.4 t/s.  The feature **stays opt-in** for r27: the device buffer allocation is a
  hard `GGML_ASSERT` on failure (an OOM aborts the process), so defaulting it on needs the same
  warn-and-fall-back treatment the FA staging arena got in issue #33.  That fallback is the prerequisite
  for the default flip (TODO item 30).
* Not run here: a gfx1151/gfx1100 rebuild (the IQ2_XS/IQ3_XXS gate restores the gfx1151 source-of-record
  behaviour by construction).

**Files.** All four PRs' `wip/` directories are now on `main`; the code changes ride in `patches/0015`.
`release.json` is regenerated (`tip`/`tree` above).  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green.

## 2026-09-30 (r26) - block-06 amendment: the op-offload prefill upload no longer serialises (issue #50 staging ring)

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r26`** (canonical tip `0d58404e16aa076521091f1b1e2f8d2d88bff5c3`, tree
`afbdc436059b11b9a18b9ac6e6481c40a28327d9`; `validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree ==
`release.json.tree`).  Only **block 06** changes in content.  Found by the `wip/moe-expert-cache` campaign
while chasing single-card prefill, which had already worked around it.

**Why.**  The r12 op-offload H2D staging ring (`GGML_SCHED_STAGE`, issue #50) is supposed to overlap a
host-resident expert upload with the previous split's compute.  Two default/gate choices defeated it on a
real offloaded-MoE prefill:

* **`GGML_SCHED_EVENTS` defaulted OFF.**  With a single graph copy the per-backend events were never
  created, so `wait_before_overwrite()` fell through to a **full device synchronize** — measured **1858
  calls / 5.2 s** in one single-R9700 8K prefill pass at `-ub 8192`.
* **`if (split->n_inputs > sched->stage_n_slots)` skipped the whole split.**  A merged routed-MoE band
  carries **31 inputs** (one 450 MiB expert weight plus ~30 tiny view/ids inputs like `inp_pos` and
  `attn_inp_k_idxs`), so the raw input count exceeded the 8 ring slots and the weight was never staged; it
  took the serial host path (routing readback + per-op `copy_experts`).

**The change** (one file, `ggml/src/ggml-backend.cpp`, +36/-7).  The staging gate counts **host-weight**
inputs (`n_host_inputs`) instead of the raw `split->n_inputs`; `sched_events` defaults **ON**
(`GGML_SCHED_EVENTS=0` opts out); and a host-resident split input bound for a simple device backend is
enqueued with an async H2D after an in-stream event wait instead of a host-blocking
`ggml_backend_event_synchronize` (gated on `event_wait != NULL`, so the Meta backend keeps its whole-split
buffer copy).

**Measured, delivery-only** (no campaign build).  Single R9700, Qwen3.8-Flash-Next IQ4_NL, `-ngl 99
-ncmoe 48 -sm layer -fa 1 --lazy-mode auto --load-mode none -t 8`, `llama-bench -p 8192 -n 0 -b 8192 -r 3`:

| config | `-ub 512` | `-ub 1024` | `-ub 2048` | `-ub 8192` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|

**Validation.**  r26 is output-preserving on qwen4exp: the single-card hash is `359ff4337837` at the
default, with `GGML_SCHED_EVENTS=0`, and with `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MIN_TOKENS=99999` (staging off) — all
identical, and identical to the campaign's validated output.  `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` 929/929;
2-GPU `-sm tensor` `-ncmoe 0` == `-ncmoe 40` == `359ff4337837` rc=0.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green
(strict 16/16 `git am` on a fresh `84e76d8a2`, applied tree `afbdc436`).

**Scope.**  A general offloaded-MoE prefill fix, independent of the expert cache: it lifts the reference
`-ub 8192` above 1000 t/s on the delivery alone.  The small-ubatch case (`-ub 512/1024/2048`) still needs
the campaign's pruned device gather (`wip/moe-expert-cache`, tip `6140bba76`, to be rebased onto r26 — its
`exp17` patch duplicates this amendment's scheduler changes and must drop them on the rebase).

## 2026-09-29 (r25) - block-15 amendment: the address-gated rope fusion is now bit-transparent (issue #67)

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r25`** (canonical tip `81fda69c81a48d48ac386d2f7175ec82cfda23ee`, tree
`c7385cd5f03d16b462ef9b586959188b8f1556e6`; `validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree ==
`release.json.tree`).  Only **block 15** changes.

**Why.**  Issue #67 (from #58 item D): on the reporter's Windows / ROCm 10 box the Q6_K greedy output swaps
one near-tie across ~1 in 8-12 fresh `llama-server` starts.  The trigger is the upstream
`ROPE -> VIEW -> SET_ROWS` fusion (`ggml_cuda_should_fuse_rope_set_rows`, upstream #16884), which
`ggml_cuda_check_fusion_memory_ranges()` selects from **buffer addresses**.  On the maintainer's gfx1201 /
ROCm 7.14 host the layout is stable, so the fusion is always on and the W=1 decode logits are a fixed
`f6d62323d9339541`; `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_ROPE_SET_ROWS=1` gives `3ab223a4f08afd6e`.

**Root cause (this is the answer to the r24 open question).**  It is **not** the graph/allocation side
effect of eliding the F32 rope buffer.  A canonicalised per-graph dump of the whole allocation plan
(60000 node/address lines, `GGML_DEBUG_ALLOC_DUMP`) is **byte-identical** between the default and
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_ROPE_SET_ROWS=1` runs - same addresses, same aliasing, same buffer sizes - so the
`ggml-cuda.cu` `add_alloc_deps` pass needs **no** rope entry.  The fused kernel itself is the difference:
a device-side dump of the exact model prefill element shows both instantiations compute the *same*
`x0`/`x1`/`cos`/`sin` and the same float result `beb67000` (= -0.3563232421875, exactly the f16 midpoint),
yet the fused `<float,__half>` kernel stored -0.3562 and the unfused `<float,float>` + `k_set_rows`
chain stored -0.3564 - i.e. clang **contracted the two template instantiations' multiply-adds
differently**, and one f16 element of the 256x1024 prefill write crossed the rounding boundary.  A focused
`rope -> view -> set_rows` test with the model's exact input file reproduces the fused-vs-unfused cache
**bit-identically**, which is why the r24 isolated test missed it: it used 8 tokens and never hit the
boundary.

**Fix.**  `#pragma clang fp contract(off)` at the top of `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/rope.cu`, so every rope
instantiation (fused `<float,half>`, unfused `<float,float>` + `k_set_rows`, and the fused
`rms_norm_mul_rope` variants) uses the same rounding and the fused kernels reproduce the chain they
replace.  The unfused chain's rounding moves to the contracted-off form too; that is the cost and it is
the same value for both, so the address-selected fusion is bit-transparent.  (An earlier attempt that
pinned only the rotation with `__fmul_rn`/`__fsub_rn` did **not** work - the contraction that differs is
not the rotation - and the file-wide pragma is the verified fix.)

**Verified** (gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14):

- `test-logits-width-probe` on `Qwen3.8-27B-Q6_K` / `prompts/recall.txt` P=256 W=1: default and
  `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_ROPE_SET_ROWS=1` now both give `60e77916673db071` (row 1 the same), and
  `width_purity=PASS` (worst maxdiff 0) for both.
- 4B same-seed coherence `1c5d32ac537d` is **unchanged** (identical to the pre-fix build and the
  `build-rocm-baseline` binary), so the non-IMROPE rope path is unaffected.
- `scripts/validate-set.sh` green (strict 16/16, applied tree == `release.json.tree`).

The default-on rope fusion is kept; the two r24 kill switches (`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_ROPE_SET_ROWS`,
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_RMS_NORM_MUL_ROPE`) stay for bisection.  See `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §41.

## 2026-09-29 (r24) - block-15 amendment: kill switches for the address-gated rope fusions (issue #58 item D)

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r24`** (canonical tip `667ff09476e55f3ddeed4fd56e6ba8305b990a2c`, tree
`94b60ec74e8ebc230c87b0b600b7cc9aa59b8a49`; `validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree ==
`release.json.tree`).  Only **block 15** changes.

**Why.**  Issue #58 item D: the reporter (@DanoPTT, gfx1201 / Windows / ROCm 10) sees Q6_K greedy output
swap one near-tie across fresh `llama-server` starts (~1 in 8-12), deterministic within a start.  This is
the address-selected-fusion class the delivery already documented in `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §30/§31: the
`topk_moe` router was the MoE instance and was made bit-identical, but the dense instance was still open.

**Finding.**  Bisected at the logits level on gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14 with the reporter's model family
(`Qwen3.8-27B-Q6_K`, `prompts/recall.txt`, `test-logits-width-probe`, P=256, W=1 row-0 hash): the only
lever that moves the decode logits is fusion, and specifically the fusions selected by
`ggml_cuda_check_fusion_memory_ranges()` (buffer-address overlap).  `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_FUSION=1` gives
`3ab223a4f08afd6e` against the default `f6d62323d9339541`, and so does disabling *all* address-gated
fusions; the upstream `ROPE -> VIEW -> SET_ROWS` fusion (`ggml_cuda_should_fuse_rope_set_rows`, upstream
#16884) is the trigger here (disabling just it reproduces `3ab2...`), while the sibling
`RMS_NORM + MUL + ROPE` fusion does not.  The other per-fusion switches left the hash at `f6d6...`, as did
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_GRAPHS=1` and `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE=0`.  20/20 fresh default starts agree on Linux (the
layout is stable here); the per-start flip is expected wherever the allocator differs.  Full table:
`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §41.

**Change.**  Two diagnostic kill switches, both default **off** so the shipped path is unchanged:
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_ROPE_SET_ROWS=1` and `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_RMS_NORM_MUL_ROPE=1`.  They let the reporter
bisect item D per-fusion on Windows instead of via the blunt `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_FUSION=1`.  Default hash
`f6d62323d9339541`, 4B same-seed coherence and `validate-set.sh` are unchanged.  The fix (make the fused
path bit-transparent, or take the address out of the selection) stays open, tracked separately from #58.

## 2026-09-29 (r23) - PR #64 integration: RDNA4 verify-band wide FA block + two more 2..8-token fusions

**Integration of PR #64 by @briansp2020** (`wip/rdna4-fa-band-wide/` and `wip/rdna4-verify-fusions-2/`,
both accepted into `main` as their own `wip/` directories).  Three `git am` patches against r21, all
folded into **block 15** (the last block).  Each is default-on with its own kill switch, so they can be
A/B tested or bisected independently.

1. **FA band: one 64-column block for query widths 5..8.**  The band folds GQA 6 into `ncols2 = 8` and
   ran `ncols1 = 4` (32 columns) per block, so a 5..8-token verify launched two column tiles and each
   streamed the whole KV cache: q8_0 attention was ~70 % slower at `n_q = 5` than at `n_q = 4` (gfx1201,
   head 256, 4 KV heads, kv 98304: 499 -> 852 us).  A band row for `ncols = 64` (512 threads,
   `nbatch_combine` 32) keeps 4 warps per Q column group, so every column sees the same KV-row split and
   the same combine order as the 32-column block and the result is bit-identical, but the cache is read
   once.  Used for the `ncols1 == 4` band from 4096 KV rows (below ~2k the 16-warp block is mostly idle
   and slower); `GGML_HIP_FA_BAND_WIDE=0` restores the two-tile launch.  gfx1201 q8_0 `n_q` 5..8: -11..-15 %
   from 4k KV rows; `n_q` 1..4 and f16 unchanged.  Server (27B UD-Q4_K_XL, q8_0, DFlash2 n-max 4): -1.4 %
   ms per verify step at 50k, -2.6 % at 97k.
2. **`ssm_gate_beta_fused_q8_0` for the verify band.**  The fused Q8_0 alpha/beta projections plus the
   softplus/sigmoid chain was decode-only (`ne[1] == 1`), so a 5-token verify ran 2 mmvq + `add_softplus_mul`
   + sigmoid per GDN layer.  The kernel now takes `ncols` as a template parameter and every token keeps the
   single-token K order, cross-warp reduction and `calc_nwarps_weight()` selector, so the band matches decode
   bit for bit.  -144 launches per 5-token pass.  `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GATE_BETA_VERIFY=0` restores the unfused
   chain.
3. **Residual ADD folded into `rms_norm_q8_1`.**  One token folds the residual ADD into the mmvq epilogue;
   at 2..8 tokens it was a standalone `k_bin_bcast` before the `rms_norm_q8_1` of the next block (128
   launches per 5-token pass).  `rms_norm_q8_1_f32` gains `has_add`: it computes `x = a + b` (one IEEE add,
   as `k_bin_bcast`), writes it out for the residual stream, then normalizes and quantizes as before.
   -127 launches per 5-token pass.  `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_ADD_RMS_Q8=0` turns it off.

The contributor measured `VQwen3.8-27B` UD-Q4_K_XL `llama-bench`: pp5 122.9 -> 126.2 t/s, pp8 164.6 ->
167.9 t/s, and about -1.7..-2 % ms per server verify step.  Only gfx1201 on ROCm 10.0 was measured on their
side.

**Independently re-verified here on ROCm 7.14 / gfx1201** (3x R9700): `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT`
**6354/6354**; `test-logits-width-probe` (27B UD-Q4_K_XL, q8_0 KV, `RS=from_w`) **PASS** with every W hash
and the row0/row1 hashes byte-identical (i) with the two fusions ON vs OFF at `P = 256`, and (ii) with the
wide band ON vs OFF at `P = 4000`, where `K->ne[1] = 4096` sends `W = 5..8` through the new 64-column row
(a probe at `P = 256` sees `K->ne[1] = 256`, so the wide block correctly does not fire there); the 4B
same-seed coherence gate is unchanged (`83eec5e9b4f0`); and the clean build stays warning-free.

## 2026-09-29 (r22) — block-15 amendment: cache the getenv() lookups on the fusion and staging hot paths (issue #65)

**Issue #65 (overdoingism):** on Windows, r14 decode is ~10 % slower than v16-ebbb18522-r11 (about 40 vs
45 t/s) and the GPU sits idle because the host spends 16-19 ms per graph in `ggml_backend_cuda_graph_compute`
(vs ~2 ms on r11).  The reporter counted `getenv` calls with an `LD_PRELOAD` shim: per 256 decoded tokens,
`LLAMA_HC_CN_DEBUG` went 0 -> **2,431,189** and `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_CONV_FUSION` 0 -> **31,204**, while every
other name stayed flat (~14,440 total).  `getenv` is cheap on Linux (so the regression barely shows there),
but every call takes a lock and rescans the environment block on Windows; 2.4 M calls add up to the missing
wall-clock.

**Call sites.**  `ggml_can_fuse_subgraph_ext()` (`ggml/src/ggml.c`) read `LLAMA_HC_CN_DEBUG` for **every
candidate fusion window** (the millions of calls above); `ggml_cuda_try_fuse()` read it again in the four
`hc_combine_norm` matcher paths; `gdn_conv_enabled()` / `ple_conv_enabled()` read
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_CONV_FUSION` on every conv launch.  All three first appeared in the r8 fold (the
`closing-the-gap` HC debug into block 15, the conv gates into block 08).

**Fix.**  Resolve each switch once: a function-local `static` at the call site (or a file-static where the
same flag is read from several sites).  The C file uses a manually cached `static int` because C requires a
constant initializer for a block-scope static.  The scan for other excessive use cached the remaining
debug/A-B flags on per-op, per-graph and per-tensor paths: `GGML_CUDA_GCDBG`, `GGML_CUDA_OP_TIMING`,
`GGML_STREAMDBG`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_MARK_LOG`, the `GGML_META_*` staging/gather gates, `GGML_CUDA_MMQ_J_MAX` /
`_ROUTED`, `GGML_Q6_COMPACT_J`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MMID_512`, `GGML_PAIR_2X`, `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED(_BF16)`,
`GDN_DBG_*`, `GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_256` / `_MAX_HEAD`, `GGML_CUDA_QSA_SLICES` / `_IDENTITY`, the scheduler's
`GGML_SCHED_*` gates (`ggml-backend.cpp`), the meta backend's `GGML_META_*` gates (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp`,
via a per-call-site `GGML_ENV_STR` macro) and `GGML_CPU_MOE_OFFLOAD_THREADS`.  The whole amendment rides in
**block 15** (the last block), including the conv switches, whose files were introduced by block 08.  Values
are read at first use, before any graph runs, so behaviour is unchanged.

**Warnings.**  The same change fixes the clean-build warnings: the `ggml_backend_graph_optimize_params`
aggregate now sets `marks_only` / `allocs_only`; the meta debug prints test `tensor->name[0]` instead of the
always-true array address; the ignored `cudaFree()` / `hipHostRegister()` results are cast to `void`; the
unused `llama_kv_cache::v_enabled` member (shadowed by the constructor parameter) is dropped; and the test
probe's unused `jmax` is removed.  A clean `-j16` rebuild is warning-free.

**Verification** (gfx1201, ROCm 7.14, 3x R9700): `scripts/validate-set.sh` strict 16/16 `git am` with the
applied tree == `release.json.tree`; a full clean build has zero warnings and zero errors; and the same-seed
greedy gate (`Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0`, `-sm tensor`) is **byte-identical to the pre-amendment build**
(`83eec5e9b4f0`, verified by rebuilding the unmodified block-15 tip in a worktree).  Release
**`v16-84e76d8a2-r22`**; tip `c0356818289975b8eccd9fb70314cf9c5bdb35f7`, tree
`c63060dc5dfd17a72cd697d70279db38c8d6ec8c`.

## 2026-09-29 — CI: drop ROCm 7.2 from the automatic release matrix (release runs were timing out)

**Symptom.** Every tagged release from r10 onward had its GitHub Release uncut: the
docker-ghcr release run ended `cancelled`, and the `Package GitHub Release` job was `skipped`.

**Root cause (confirmed from the Actions API).**  In every failed run the **`Build ROCm 7.2` job was
cancelled at exactly the build job's 6 h `timeout-minutes`** while `Build ROCm 7.14` and
`Build ROCm 10.0` succeeded:

| run | tag | 7.2 | 7.14 | 10.0 |
|-----|-----|-----|------|------|
| 45 (last good) | r9  | success 290 min | success 122 min | success 197 min |
| 46 | r10 | **cancelled 360 min** | success 274 min | success 259 min |
| 54 | r18 | **cancelled 360 min** | success 260 min | success 151 min |
| 56 | r21 | **cancelled 361 min** | success 214 min | success 166 min |

r9's 7.2 build was already 290 min of a 360 min budget; the `-complete` base compiles far more slowly
than the `-full` lines, and once a build times out it never writes the registry build cache
(`cache-to: type=registry`), so every later attempt started cold and exceeded the budget again.  The
`release` job declares `needs: [prepare, build]`, so one timed-out build skipped the GitHub Release on
every tag push.  The 7.2 line was already flagged in `TODO.md` item 22 as a suspected purity break
(reported, never reproduced), so it is not a line worth blocking releases for.

**Change.**  `.github/workflows/docker-ghcr.yml`: the automatic default matrix is now `7.14 10.0`
(the `workflow_dispatch` default and the push/schedule fallback), the release-note image list drops
7.2, and the `7.2` matrix case is kept but documented as manual-dispatch-only.  `CONTAINERS.md` and
`TODO.md` item 22 updated to match.  No patch, `release.json` or block change; `validate.yml` is
unaffected.

**Follow-up for the maintainer.**  A workflow change on `main` does not retroactively fix the already
pushed tags' runs (they replay the workflow from the tagged commit), so the r13–r21 GitHub Releases
still need to be cut — either re-push those tags after this lands, dispatch a manual release, or
`gh release create` them from the packaged assets.  The image-only `workflow_dispatch` path cannot cut
a Release by design.

## 2026-09-28 (r21, PR #63) — block-08 + block-14 amendments: five bit-exact verify-band fusions

**Integration of PR #63 by @briansp2020** (`wip/rdna4-verify-fusions/`, accepted into `main` as its own
`wip/` directory).  Four of the five patches fold into **block 08** (`norm.cu`, `norm.cuh`, `unary.cu`,
`unary.cuh`, `ggml-cuda.cu`); the GDN conv-input concat patch folds into **block 14** (`concat.cu`).  A
5-token DFlash2 n-max-4 verify pass of the dense 27B launched 2,171 kernels against 1,485 for one token
because several decode fusions were gated to `ne[1] == 1`.

1. **`rms_norm_q8_1` weight stride (latent bug fix).**  The kernel offsets the single-row norm weight by
   `row * stride`; the host passed `nb[1]`, so every row after the first read past the weight end.  Decode
   only ever hit row 0, so it was invisible until patch 3 made the fusion multi-row.  Stride 0 for a
   single-row weight, as the unfused `rms_norm` + `mul` broadcast does.
2. **`rms_norm` + `scale`** (the GDN q/k l2 norm) in one kernel, every width: 96 launches fewer per token.
3. **norm -> Q8_1 and gated unary -> Q8_1 cache pre-fill for 2..8 tokens** (RDNA4): the producers are
   row-generic and leave the matmul unchanged; `MUL_MAT_ID` keeps its `mmid_single` guard.
4. **GDN conv-input concat**: the tiled transpose kernel from 2 tokens instead of 32.
5. **GDN gate chain** `add(dt) -> softplus -> mul(a)` in one kernel for 2..8 tokens (the existing unary+mul
   fusion needs equal shapes; `dt`/`ssm_a` are per-head broadcast).

All five have kill switches (default on) and are bit-exact.

**Verified on ROCm 7.14 / gfx1201** (Qwen3.8-27B UD-Q4_K_XL, q8_0 KV): full `test-backend-ops`
**18905/18905**; same-seed greedy text is **identical to r20 (`017e51ea04b1`)** and
`none == n1 == n3 == n7` (the `rms_norm_q8_1` fix is exercised by the multi-row path, else the verify

## 2026-09-28 (r21, PR #62) — block-15 amendment: RDNA4 GQA-6 FA band gets 64-wide K/V batches + 8 warps

**Integration of PR #62 by @briansp2020** (`wip/rdna4-fa-band/`, accepted into `main` as its own `wip/`
directory).  Only **block 15** changes content (`fattn-mma-f16.cuh`).

**Patch 1 (bit-exact).**  The RDNA4 GQA-6 decode/verify band (`flash_attn_ext_f16<256,256,4,8>`) staged K
and V in one 128-half2 batch; with native q8_0 K/V it read its cache at ~310 GB/s and sat at 256 VGPRs
with spills.  A band-only config row now loads K and V in two 64-half2 batches, and 256-dim non-MLA heads
iterate the K batches **forward** (the reverse order existed only for MLA's K->V reuse), so the split
reproduces the single-batch accumulation order and is bit-identical.  The config lookup now carries
`ncols2` so only the band takes the row; every other 256-dim config has a single K batch, so `K_forward`
is a no-op outside the band.

**Patch 2 (rounding change, W-pure).**  8 warps per block (256 threads, occupancy 1) instead of 4 splits
each Q column's KV rows 4 ways instead of 2: not bit-identical to patch 1, but the split does not depend
on `n_q`, so `W = 1..8` stay identical to each other.

**Verified on ROCm 7.14 / gfx1201** (Qwen3.8-27B UD-Q4_K_XL, q8_0 KV, one R9700): full
`test-backend-ops` **18905/18905**; same-seed greedy text (`prompts/reasoning.txt`, seed 42, 300 tok) is
**identical to r20 (`017e51ea04b1`) and `none == n1 == n3 == n7`** (patch 2's rounding change did not flip
a greedy token); decode-path perplexity (`-ub 1 -c 2048 --chunks 8`) **5.0109 +/- 0.1274 -> 5.0187 +/-
0.1277** (within noise); `tg128 @ d50000` **24.42 -> 25.52 t/s (+4.5 %)**.

**Factual note for the author:** the new row matches `ncols == 32`, i.e. the **native-quantized** band arm
(`ncols1 = 4`).  The 2-byte f16/bf16 arm uses `ncols1 = 2` -> `ncols = 16` and is **unaffected** (measured
f16 KV `tg128 @ d16384`: 27.50 -> 27.57, within noise), so the README's "f16 3-4 %" is misattributed
(likely a pre-r5 measurement).  Extending the 64-wide row to the 2-byte arm is a documented follow-up.

## 2026-09-28 (r21, PR #57) — block-10 + block-13 amendments: RDNA4 multi-row mmvq verify blocks + exact `__mul24` scale multiplies

**Integration of PR #57 by @briansp2020** (`wip/mmvq-verify-rows/`, accepted into `main` as its own
`wip/` directory in the same change).  Two blocks change content: **block 13** gains the multi-row dense
mmvq weight launch, **block 10** gains the exact 24-bit scale multiplies in the k/i-quant dot products.

**Block 13 — multi-row blocks for the ksplit weight kernel (`mmvq.cu`).**  `calc_rows_per_block` falls
through to 1 for the RDNA tables, so a 2..8-column verify batch re-read every q8_1 activation column once
per weight row.  `calc_rows_per_block_weight()` (new) computes 1/2/4 rows per block per weight type while
the launch still has `>= 512` blocks and the row count is a multiple of the block height (otherwise it
falls back to one row, so a multi-row block never reads past the weight end).  Per-row arithmetic, thread
mapping, K order and warp reduction are unchanged, so `W = 1..8` stays bit-identical.

**Block 10 — exact 24-bit multiplies (`vecdotq.cuh`).**  The per-sub-block scale multiplies in the
Q2_K/Q3_K-Q6_K and IQ2/IQ3/IQ4 mmvq dot products compiled to `v_mul_lo_u32`, which is quarter rate on
RDNA.  The operands are small (dp4a sums < 2^19, scales/mins <= 6 bits), so `__mul24` (via
`ggml_cuda_mul_small`, HIP only) is exact and full rate; CUDA keeps the plain multiply.  Results are
bit-identical.

**Verification (gfx1201, ROCm 7.14, one R9700, `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`).**

* `test-backend-ops` full suite: **18905/18905**.
* Same-seed greedy text (`Q4_K_XL`, q8_0 KV, `prompts/reasoning.txt`, seed 42, temp 0, 300 tok) is
  **byte-identical to r20** and `none == n1 == n3 == n7 == 017e51ea04b1`.
* `llama-batched-bench -npp 16 -ntg 32 -npl 1,4,8` (q8_0 KV): **B=1 28.24 -> 28.32**, **B=4 78.67 ->
  89.11 (+13.3 %)** , **B=8 93.53 -> 125.66 (+34.4 %)**; B=1 is within noise and B=4/B=8 improve (rule 5).
* MTP (`-n 2000`, `prompts/prose-rdna-boosts.txt`): `none` 27.2 -> 27.3, `n3` 58.9 -> **65.7 (+11.5 %)**,
  `n7` 53.6 -> **69.4 (+29.5 %)**; acceptance **identical** (`0.82849` n3 / `0.62347` n7), pos-1 0.925 / 0.887.
* Kernel A/B (`test-backend-ops perf`, m=4096 `k=14336`, repeated): q3_K +7..+24 %, q4_K +8..+38 %,
  q6_K +3..+27 %, q2_K +12..+26 % (plus +14 % at n=1 from `__mul24`); the author's per-type table
  transfers.  **ROCm-7.14-specific dips** vs their ROCm 10.0 sweep: q5_1 -3..-4 % and iq4_xs -3..-4 % at
  n=2/3 (both +10..+12 % at n=8); the aggregate verify band is a large net win and the table is kept as
  tuned, with a per-type retune a documented follow-up.

## 2026-09-28 (r20) — block-10 + block-11 amendments: dense Q6_K `VDR=2` restored and spec-verify batches keep HIP graphs (issue #58)

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r20`** (canonical tip `8fe002a16`, tree `6f8369bf06aa54afa7470e204fef2ac7ae6e8853`;
`validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree == `release.json.tree`).  Only **block 10** and
**block 11** change content; blocks 00-09 and 12-15 keep their bodies and get new SHAs.

Issue **#58** (DanoPTT, gfx1201, Windows/ROCm 10, `ukisai/Swift-Qwen3.8-27B` Q6_K and Q5_K_M) reported four
things.  This release lands two of them (**A** and **C**); the other two (**B**, the `m=1024 k=5120 n=1`
small-M geometry, and **D**, a Windows-only cross-start greedy/PPL nondeterminism) stay open.

### A — dense Q6_K `VDR=2` (block 10)

The 2026-09-12 (16) amendment reverted block 10's VDR boost **globally** to fix the issue-#30 MTP verify
regression, but that reasoning was valid for Q4_K/Q5_K's `vdr4` (32 elements/call) — Q6_K is `vdr2`
(16/call) and was swept in unmeasured.  Dense Q6_K now uses `_vdr2` again, **scoped to RDNA4/RDNA3_0**
(mirroring the Q8_0 MoE gate; other archs keep upstream VDR 1).  The VDR is a per-type compile-time
constant, so `W = 1..8` stays band-uniform by construction.

**Measured** on the reporter's models (`llama-batched-bench -npl 1,4,8`, the issue-#30 gate, gfx1201):

| model | gate | stock r19 | r20 (VDR=2) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Swift`-class Q6_K (unsloth Q6_K) | B=1 / B=4 / B=8 | 23.22 / 63.64 / 74.29 | 23.57 / **69.92** / **86.61** t/s |
| `Swift-Qwen3.8-27B-Q5_K_M` | B=1 / B=4 / B=8 | 25.92 / 71.10 / 83.68 | 25.98 / **71.76** / **85.89** t/s |

Pre-fill unchanged; `test-backend-ops` Q6_K `m=4096 n=8` 206.6 -> 169.1 us.  Greedy purity:
`plain == draft-mtp n3 ==` verify-graphs-off (`581aca110917`).

### C — spec-verify batches keep HIP graphs (block 11)

The r10 heuristic classifies every `n_tokens > 1` graph as pre-fill and skips the graph path; that is correct
for prefill (a varying ubatch, where capture never amortises) but wrong for the spec-verify widths (2..8),
whose shape is fixed every step.  `ggml_cuda_graph_is_multi_token()` now returns
`n_tokens > (verify_graphs_off ? 1 : MMVQ_MAX_BATCH_SIZE)`, so only true prefill skips; the graph cache is
keyed per `(first node, n_tokens)` (new `ggml_cuda_graph_key`) so decode and each verify width keep separate
graphs and do not reset one another's warmup under adaptive MTP.  `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_VERIFY_GRAPHS=1` restores
the old behaviour.

**Measured** (gfx1201, `draft-mtp n=3`): graphs replay (`warmups/replays` 3/32 vs 1/22 with the kill switch;
`graphs reused = 20` in `print_timing`).  The throughput win is host-dependent — **~+0.8-1.3 % on
Linux/ROCm 7.14** here versus the reporter's **+16-19 %** on Windows/ROCm 10 (higher kernel-launch overhead) —
and a small 4B graph measured ~2.5 % slower, so the kill switch stays and a size gate is a documented
follow-up.

**Validation**: strict 16/16 `git am` on `84e76d8a2`, applied tree `6f8369bf06aa…`, `test-backend-ops` green,
MTP/plain width-purity byte-identical (`581aca110917`).

## 2026-09-28 (r19) — block-06 amendment: the offloaded-MoE decode runs multi-threaded (capped) instead of serialised

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r19`** (canonical tip `16977e9d16aacaa430535a98e8d9cb84efb4b910`, tree
`296c811167f00c3dcb46caf49303fa610e2f0e0b`; `validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree ==
`release.json.tree`).  Only **block 06** changes content; blocks 07-15 keep their bodies and get new SHAs.

**Bug.**  r17's tiny-CPU-graph heuristic (`ggml_backend_cpu_graph_n_threads`) exempted `MUL_MAT_ID`'s
**src0** from its byte count, so an offloaded-MoE decode graph (a handful of 1-token `MUL_MAT_ID` nodes
under `-ncmoe`) measured "tiny" and ran **on one thread**.  r17 measured that as a win: Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
Q8_0 `-ncmoe 99` `tg64` 13.8 (multi-threaded) vs 24.4 (one thread).

**Why the r17 measurement was confounded.**  This host pins its GPU IRQs to the highest `NUM_GPUS` cores
(`/usr/local/bin/pin_gpu_irqs.sh`: `NUM_CPUS - NUM_GPUS + i`; with 3x R9700 that is cores **13, 14, 15**).
llama.cpp's default `n_threads` is *every* core, so the multi-threaded arm put the worker pool on the GPU's
IRQ cores and starved the device.  Isolating the two effects (Q4_K_M `-ncmoe 99`, `tg1024`, heuristic OFF):

| config | tps |
|---|---:|
| `-t 16` (all cores, collides with IRQs 13-15) | 19.6 |
| `-t 16` `taskset -c 0-7` (identical thread count, one CCD) | 36.0 |
| `-t 16` `--cpu-mask 0xFFF` (12 cores, but still 16 threads) | 29.1 |
| `-t 13` / `-t 14` / `-t 15` | 38.6 / 37.1 / 35.0 |
| `-t 12` / `-t 8` | 38.6 / 38.9 |

So the loss is the collision (and, second, cross-CCD traffic) rather than a thread-pool re-arm cost:
`--poll 0` changes nothing (17.3 vs 19.2), which rules out the KMP active-wait the r17 note blamed.
**One CCD (`-t 8`) is within 1-2 % of the best thread count on all three MoE models tested**, and it dodges
both penalties without the user having to know the IRQ policy.

**Fix.**  `ggml_backend_cpu_graph_n_threads` now walks the graph for a `MUL_MAT_ID` whose `src[0]` is
host-resident **but not in this CPU backend's buffer type** — the signature of experts placed in a GPU
backend's pinned host buffer (`-ncmoe`).  Such a graph is not tiny in work, so it runs multi-threaded but
**capped at `max(1, hardware_concurrency()/2)`** (a CPU+GPU split is a pipeline; the CPU side must not own
every core).  `GGML_CPU_MOE_OFFLOAD_THREADS=N` overrides it: `N > 0` is an explicit cap, `0` removes it.
An override above the default **warns once**, naming the reason — so an uncapped run is an informed choice
rather than a silent 2x loss.  The `GET_ROWS` exemption (the heuristic's original purpose) is untouched,
and `GGML_CPU_DISABLE_TINY_GRAPH_SINGLE_THREAD=1` still disables the whole heuristic for A/B.

**Measured** (`-ncmoe 99`, `-t 16`, d0 unless noted; "r18" = the same build with
`GGML_CPU_MOE_OFFLOAD_THREADS=1`, which reproduces the one-thread behaviour exactly):

| model | r18 | **r19 (capped)** | gain |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q8_0 | 24.80 | **29.44** | +18.7 % |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4_K_M | 29.11 | **38.01** | +30.6 % |
| gemma-4-26B-A4B Q4_K_XL | 21.99 | **37.44** | +70.3 % |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q8_0 @ d16384 | 23.39 | **28.77** | +23.0 % |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4_K_M @ d16384 | 28.11 | **37.03** | +31.7 % |
| gemma-4-26B-A4B Q4_K_XL @ d16384 | 21.51 | **35.82** | +66.5 % |

plus **MTP `draft-mtp n3` on Q4_K_M: acceptance `0.79268` unchanged, 30.91 -> 56.15 t/s (+81.7 %)** — the
spec-decode case the heuristic was written for — and `pp512` Q4_K_M 504.05 (capped) vs 499.60 (uncapped),
so prefill is not hurt.  The power-user path works as well: uncapped + `-t 8` gives 29.71 / 38.33 / 37.82.

**Purity.**  The CPU thread count does not change the delivery's arithmetic, so this is a perf-only change:
the delivered `-ncmoe` text is **`431bbf3a1605`** at `-t 1`, `-t 8`, `-t 12`, `-t 16`, with the cap, with
`GGML_CPU_MOE_OFFLOAD_THREADS=0|12`, and with the heuristic disabled.  Only the offloaded-MoE branch
changes; a non-MoE model is untouched (4B dense coherence gate unchanged at 93.6 t/s) and a CPU-only run
keeps its weights in the CPU buffer type, so it never takes the cap.

**User-facing consequence (recorded in `AGENTS.md`).**  On a host that pins GPU IRQs to particular cores,
size `-t` (or `--cpu-mask`, with `-t` *inside* the mask) to leave those cores free; one CCD's worth of
threads is the robust choice.  Several earlier benchmark records in this repo predate this and may be
IRQ-contaminated wherever they used the default `-t`.

## 2026-09-28 (r18) — block-13 amendment: the qwen35moe SSM gate/beta fusion is now width-uniform

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r18`** (canonical tip `135ce8b7325083be13b0395f2131522c6fe8f8bd`, tree
`df3f6ec9467f4b0c3db85491374da70a3d0c1dc3`; `validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree ==
`release.json.tree`).  Only **block 13** changes content.

**Bug.**  Block 08 added the qwen35moe SSM gate/beta fusion (`ggml_cuda_op_ssm_gate_beta`): it fuses the two
Q8_0 alpha/beta projections and their softplus/sigmoid gating chain into one kernel, but the matcher only
accepts `alpha_w->src[1]->ne[1] == 1` — **decode only**.  Block 13 then introduced the dense mmvq *weight*
rule `calc_nwarps_weight()` (2026-09-12 (18): a Q8_0 weight with `K < 4096` takes the wide block, 8 warps on
RDNA4), which the standalone launch uses — but the decode-only fusion kept pinning plain `calc_nwarps()` (1
warp).  So W = 1 (fused) and W >= 2 (unfused) reduced K with different warp counts.  That violates
`GREEDY-PURITY.md` invariant 1 ("one arm, chosen from the `n_tokens` band ... never from the exact width"),
and the symptom is a **width-impurity**: `--spec-type none` and `--spec-type draft-mtp` diverge once a
near-tie is reached — on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (`n_embd` 2048 < 4096) after ~200 tokens.

| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q8_0, `-ncmoe 99`, 300 tokens, seed 42, fusions ON | `none` | `n1` | `n3` | `n7` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| r17 | `6744006631df` | - | `431bbf3a1605` | - |
| **r18** | **`431bbf3a1605`** | **`431bbf3a1605`** | **`431bbf3a1605`** | **`431bbf3a1605`** |

**Fix.**  `ggml_cuda_op_ssm_gate_beta` now selects `calc_nwarps_weight(GGML_TYPE_Q8_0, 1, table_id, long_k)`
with `long_k = src1->ne[0] >= 4096`, i.e. exactly the standalone launch's selector (9 insertions in
`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/mmvq.cu`).  The fused decode is now bit-identical to the unfused verify chain, so the
fusion stays ON (no perf change).  It is a **no-op for `K >= 4096`**, so the long-K models keep the pinned
single-token order (the 4B is measurably unaffected: `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SSM_GATE_BETA` on/off hash equal).

**Validation** (canonical r18 build, gfx1201): the delivered path is now pure — `none == n1 == n3 == n7`
at 300 tokens and `none == n3` over 1000 tokens; MTP acceptance unchanged (`0.77654`, pos-1 0.883);
`test-backend-ops` `MUL_MAT_ID` / `GATED_DELTA_NET` / `SSM_CONV` all 2/2; the 4B smoke gate is coherent
(93.4 t/s) and byte-unchanged; no `mmvq.cu` perf regression observed.

**Found via** the decode-side MoE expert-cache campaign (`archive/work/moe-expert-cache/`) while validating the
cache's `W = 1..8` width purity; the campaign's force-copy A/B had already proved the cache itself was not
reading stale bytes.  The bug is delivery-generic — it affects the shipped `-ncmoe` path with fusions on,
with or without the cache — and `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §39 records it.

## 2026-09-27 (r17) — block-06 amendment: restore host-resident MoE **decode** (the r13 tiny-graph heuristic over-counted it)

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r17`** (canonical tip `20b0efc5b273b26f6892012edb07d81e08b44d30`, tree
`dc7ce12a6af627b0f140b9743e62bc0204f11b10`; `validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree ==
`release.json.tree`).  Only **block 06** changes content.

**Regression.**  r13's issue-#52 fix made the tiny-CPU-graph heuristic count the bytes a graph *reads*
(`node->src[j]`), not just its node outputs, so a CPU-offloaded dense FFN chunk is no longer serialized on
one thread.  That is correct for a `MUL_MAT` chunk, but the rule also counted **`MUL_MAT_ID`'s src0 = the
whole expert weight table** (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B: 144 MiB per tensor).  At decode the offloaded MoE graph is 3
tiny `MUL_MAT_ID` nodes per layer (~120 one-token graphs per pass under `-ncmoe`), and with the table
counted it became "not tiny" → multi-threaded, where the per-graph thread-pool re-arm dominates the actual
work:

| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B **Q8_0**, `tg64`, `-ncmoe 99`, 1 GPU | r12 (pre-r13) | r13..r16 | **r17** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| pinned (`LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS` default) | 24.26 ± 0.14 | 13.80 ± 1.25 | **24.38 ± 0.04** |
| pageable (`LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS=0`) | 22.98 ± 0.05 | 13.48 ± 1.15 | 22.74 ± 0.03 |

(2-GPU all-host and `-sm tensor` were regressed the same way; the all-resident `-ncmoe 0` case is unchanged
at ~79.9 because its MoE runs on the GPU.)

**Fix.**  Exempt `MUL_MAT_ID` src0 from the byte count exactly as `GET_ROWS` src0 already is — both are
tables of which a small batch reads only a few rows.  `ggml/src/ggml-cpu/ggml-cpu.cpp`, 12 insertions / 3
deletions.  The dense-`MUL_MAT` path issue #52 was about is untouched (no `MUL_MAT` clause changed), so the
8.7 → 1.7 t/s `MUL_MAT` fix is preserved.  `GGML_CPU_DISABLE_TINY_GRAPH_SINGLE_THREAD=1` remains the A/B
kill-switch.

**Verification.**  Same-seed greedy text bit-identical (`359ff4337837`); the fixed build restores the r12
decode number to within noise and removes the ±1.25 variance (the multi-threaded path was the noisy one).

**Why it matters now:** host-resident MoE decode is the baseline the new
[`archive/work/moe-expert-cache/`](archive/work/moe-expert-cache/README.md) campaign starts from — it had to be restored
before that campaign can measure anything.

## 2026-09-27 (r16) — host-resident-expert prefill fast path is now default; `-sm tensor -ncmoe` wins at every level

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r16`** (canonical tip `92b14a6131905dc6efcd4500dcf4f1dc5a28531b`, tree
`46a5a43d49c8fa4dfa7a4120805d69c0132b4906`; `scripts/validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`,
applied tree == `release.json.tree`).  Cut from the prefill campaign `archive/work/tensor-split-expert-split/` (see its
`REPORT-ncmoe-prefill.md`, `sweep-full.csv` and README §30).  **Block 15** carries the change (amending the
last block avoided re-basing the chain around block 06; the natural long-term home is block 06, the
general system-operations bucket).

Promoted, all **default-on** and self-selecting, each with a kill-switch:

* **Op-offload H2D staging on by default** (`GGML_SCHED_STAGE=0` reverts).  It overlaps a host→device
expert upload with the previous split's compute.  Measured at pp8192: 2 GPU `-sm tensor -ncmoe`
3271 → 5364 (+64 %), 1 GPU `-ncmoe` 3203 → 5852 (+83 %), 2 GPU `-sm layer -ncmoe` 2744 → 4116
(+50 %); neutral when nothing is offloaded (experts on device, dense models).  Also fixes the
capability fallback: a non-stage-capable backend now turns staging off instead of warning and leaving
it on.
* **Split expert upload staged per device** — the meta `stage_input` gained the split branch (gate/up
axis 1, down axis 0), gathering each device's slice into its ring slot on the copy stream.  The guard
that decides whether the per-device slice sizes sum to one chunk was comparing against the whole-tensor
`size` instead of `chunk_size_full`, so it always returned false and the run silently fell back to the
slow pageable 2-D splice; fixed (a one-line comparison against `chunk_size_full`, matching the splice's
own `GGML_ASSERT(offset_j == chunk_size_full)`).
* **Pinned splice gather** (`GGML_CUDA_SPLICE_GATHER=0` reverts) — the compact strided host→device
upload now gathers into a pinned ring slot and issues one queued 1-D H2D instead of the pageable
`hipMemcpy2DAsync` (which is both ~5-7× slower and the source of the §22 fault).  Fixes small ub:
split `-sm tensor -ncmoe` at ub 512 85 → 592 t/s, ub 1536 224 → 1224.
* Split expert copies (`GGML_META_SPLIT_COPY=0` reverts to the pre-existing mirrored behaviour) and the
pinned host-expert source from r15 (`LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS=0`) complete the set.

**Result** (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M, 1×/2× R9700 gfx1201, pp8192/ub8192, upstream = plain master
`84e76d8a2`): the default 2-GPU `-sm tensor -ncmoe` beats stock at every offload level — **+91 %** at
`-ncmoe 0` rising to **+148 %** at `-ncmoe 40` (all experts host) against upstream's best 2-GPU option
(`-sm layer`, the only one upstream supports with `-ncmoe`), and the `tensor`-vs-`layer` margin itself
grows +21 % → +33 %.  Same-seed greedy output is bit-identical to the pre-change build; `MUL_MAT_ID` and
`FLASH_ATTN_EXT` backend-op tests are green.  Full 0..40 tables: campaign `sweep-full.csv` and the
GitHub Discussion announcement.

**Known follow-up (documented, not a blocker):** the promotion carries the campaign's env-gated debug/A-B
knobs (e.g. `GGML_META_STAGEDBG`, `GGML_CUDA_GCDBG`) alongside the user-facing kill-switches; a cleanup
pass should fold them out before any `upstream/` PR candidate is cut.

**The bug.**  When MoE expert weights are host-resident (`-ncmoe`) and the scheduler op-offloads them,
every ubatch H2D-uploads the experts it uses.  `src/llama-model-loader.cpp`'s `select_weight_buft`
deliberately discards the pinned host buffer type when the model is mmap'd:

```c
// avoid using a host buffer when using mmap
if (use_mmap && buft_dev && buft == ggml_backend_dev_host_buffer_type(buft_dev)) {
    buft = ggml_backend_dev_buffer_type(cpu_dev);   // -> CPU_Mapped, i.e. the pageable model mmap
}
```

so every one of those uploads reads the pageable model mapping.  On ROCm 7.14 that is doubly costly:
`hipMemcpyAsync` from a pageable source **blocks the host for the whole transfer** (measured 10.461 ms
for 144 MiB against 0.001 ms pinned), so the two cards' DMAs cannot overlap and the host cannot run
ahead; and the meta backend's 2-D spliced upload — the `-sm tensor` split-copy path — **faults** inside
`hipMemcpy2DAsync` (`__amd_rocclr_copyBufferRectAligned`) from that same pageable source.

**The fix.**  Skip the downgrade for `MUL_MAT_ID` weights — precisely the tensors the scheduler's
op-offload uploads every ubatch:

```c
static const bool host_experts = [] {
    const char * e = getenv("LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS");
    return e == nullptr || atoi(e) != 0;
}();
...
if (use_mmap && buft_dev && buft == ggml_backend_dev_host_buffer_type(buft_dev) &&
        !(host_experts && op == GGML_OP_MUL_MAT_ID)) { ... downgrade ... }
```

Default **on**; `LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS=0` restores the old mmap behaviour.  It only affects
CPU-resident `MUL_MAT_ID` weights (on-device experts keep their GPU buffer type, and a pure-CPU load gets
the CPU buffer type, so nothing changes there).  Cost: the expert set lives in pinned, non-swappable RAM
(e.g. ~17 GiB for the 35B-A3B Q4_K_M) instead of the file mapping.

**Why block 06.**  It is the delivery's general system-operations bucket and already owns a loader hunk
(the per-layer token-embedding buft choice), so the two loader changes sit together.  The change depends
on no other block; blocks 07-15 replay cleanly on the amended block 06 and the resulting tree is as
recorded.  It is also a clean `upstream/` PR candidate (see below).

**Validation (gfx1201, 2x R9700).**

* **Coherence gate:** the same-seed greedy text is **byte-identical** with the experts pinned and with
the old mmap behaviour (`llama-cli -m Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_M -ngl 99 -ncmoe 99 -sm tensor -fa 1
-p "The capital of France is" -n 20 --seed 42 --temp 0`, `sha=359ff4337837` in both).  The change moves
only the buffer type, never the arithmetic.
* **Throughput (the win):** `llama-bench -ncmoe 99 -fa 1 -p 8192 -ub 8192 -b 8192 -sm tensor`, 2 GPUs:
**5104 t/s pinned vs 2794 t/s unpinned (+83 %)**.  The pageable path also loses the `-sm tensor` split
entirely (it faults), so the fix is a correctness gate for that path as well.
* `scripts/validate-set.sh` green (strict 16/16 `git am` on a fresh `84e76d8a2`, applied tree
`d609d34d1`); block 06 changes in content, blocks 07-15 in their `From`/`index` lines only.

**Provenance and the open split question.**  The fix came out of the `archive/work/tensor-split-expert-split`
campaign (splitting the mirrored MoE expert upload instead of duplicating it).  That campaign's *split
copy* is **not** promoted: it is implemented and numerically correct, but at ub 8192 the split's upload is
fully exposed (the meta backend has no `event_record`/`event_wait`, so the scheduler falls back to a full
host synchronize before every expert upload), and the `ffn_down_exps` axis-0 split makes the upload
524288 tiny blocks per layer.  The campaign's real, promotable finding was the **pinning** — measured
+85 % on the mirrored path — which is this block-06 change.  Both forks of note independently do the same
thing (GenerelSchwerz's `moe-cache` branch ships pinned host staging and its tip commit is literally
"stage automatically pageable MoE legacy sources"; see the wip README §26 for the comparison).  The
split work continues on the wip branch.

## 2026-09-27 (r14) — block-15 amendment: the derived kq-mask window moves onto the GPU (issue #53)

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r14`** (canonical tip `e7b9b14cdf1050accd3dc00e6791458a22d0a7df`, tree
`7790b6066174e8ad27d6c12d5c3e742f82a8b1c1`; `scripts/validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`,
applied tree == `release.json.tree`).  Only **block 15** changes content.

**The bug (issue #53).**  The r10 fully-masked KV-group skip built its batch-wide bitmap by
*dereferencing `tok_lo`/`tok_hi` on the host* in `launch_fattn`.  The derived tensors are host graph
inputs (created with `ggml_set_input`, and `set_input_kq_derived` asserts
`ggml_backend_buffer_is_host`), but the backend scheduler copies a `GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_INPUT` to the
compute backend — `ggml_backend_sched_buffer_supported()` returns false for a host input when
`n_copies <= 1` (forcing a split-input copy), and `ggml_backend_sched_split_graph()` creates the copy
otherwise — so `dst->src[5..7]` seen by the CUDA launcher are the **device** copies.  Reading them
from the CPU is an access violation wherever the allocation is not CPU-mapped: on Windows/WDDM the
reporter saw `0xC0000005` in `ggml-hip.dll` at a fixed offset on the very first prefill ubatch with
the skip on (`GGML_CUDA_FA_MASK_SKIP=0` avoided it), and the same test binary segfaulted on the first
`derived=1` `test-backend-ops` case.  On Linux the gfx1201 box masks it (R9700 device memory is
CPU-accessible here), which is why every r10-r13 gate was green.

**The fix.**  `flash_attn_kq_derived_blocks` now computes the batch-wide `[lo_min, hi_max]` window
itself from the device-resident `tok_lo`/`tok_hi` (a cooperative block reduction across the 256
threads, then a shared tree, before the early return).  The min/max are the same integers the host
computed, so the bitmap is byte-for-byte identical and the skip stays exact.  The cooperative form
(rather than a serial per-word scan) keeps the added work at O(n_tps/256) per block, and on Linux it
also removes the pre-fix host reads of device memory.

The same class of bug is fixed in `tests/test-backend-ops.cpp`: the `derived_hole`
(`cell_pos`/`tok_lo`/`tok_hi`), packed `mask_hole` and `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` (`idx`/`m`) initializers wrote
`t->data` directly instead of going through `ggml_backend_tensor_set`, so on Windows no derived case
ran at all (reported in the same issue).  The QSA tensors are block-14 test code; the fix rides in
block 15 because it is the last block.

**Validation (gfx1201, R9700).**

* `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` on ROCm0: **6354/6354** with the MMA path and **6354/6354**
  with the tile path forced (`GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_256=0`); the 20 derived/`mask_hole` cases and
  `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` **26/26** pass.  The derived cases include the interior-hole skip (`derived_hole`)
  and the `n_q = 9..16` wide-verify band.
* 4B Q8_0, `-c 4096 -fa on`, same-seed greedy text **identical** across `{skip on, GGML_CUDA_FA_MASK_SKIP=0,
  LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED=0}`.
* **No regression:** interleaved (`FIX PRE PRE FIX`) `llama-bench -p 8192 -r 5` against the pre-fix
  block-15 build, 4 runs each: fixed **7176 t/s** vs pre-fix **7167 t/s** (mean, ~+0.13 %, within
  noise); same-binary `GGML_CUDA_FA_MASK_SKIP=1` vs `=0` was 7709/7254 vs 7653/7229 t/s (pp2048/8192),
  i.e. the bitmap prepass costs nothing.

The reporter (@DanoPTT, Windows 11 / R9700 / ROCm 10.0.0) can be asked to re-test the r14 build for
the server crash and the `derived=1` test case.

## 2026-09-27 (r13) — block-06 amendment: the tiny-CPU-graph heuristic counts the tensors a node reads (issue #52)

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r13`** (canonical tip `77be59394258e10c90533dd595211d13b1b8d3fb`, tree
`b1a3bf1a845631f4cecb23ec50efd17309ad9c51`; `scripts/validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`,
applied tree == `release.json.tree`).  Only **block 06** changes content; blocks 07-15 move only their
`From <sha>`/`index` lines.

**The bug (issue #52).**  The single-thread CPU-graph heuristic folded in from `beta/mmb-general` 0028
(release r8) decided "tiny" by summing `ggml_nbytes()` over the nodes' **output** tensors.  Outputs are
activations (~16 KiB at decode width), so a CPU-offloaded FFN chunk — four `MUL_MAT` nodes whose weights
are read in full (tens of MiB) every token — was classified tiny and executed on one thread.  Reporter
(RX 9070, Ryzen 9800X3D): 8.66 -> 1.74 t/s on Qwen3.8-27B IQ4_XS with 39 FFN blocks on the CPU;
`GGML_CPU_DISABLE_TINY_GRAPH_SINGLE_THREAD=1` restored 8.66.

**Reproduction (gfx1201 + 9950X3D, 16 cores/SMT off).**  Qwen3.8-27B IQ4_NL, `-ngl 999
-ot 'blk\.([0-9]|[1-2][0-9]|3[0-8])\.ffn_.*=CPU' -fa on -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0`:
`tg64` r12 **3.22**, r13 **4.76 / 4.88 / 5.02**, kill-switch **4.87 / 4.95 / 4.82** — the fix matches
full-thread behavior within run-to-run noise.  (The absolute gap to the reporter's 8.66 is host memory
bandwidth — this box's DDR5 is configured for capacity, not speed.)

**The fix.**  `ggml_backend_cpu_graph_n_threads()` now adds each node's non-view input tensors to the
byte estimate, so a weight-heavy graph exceeds the 16 MiB bound and keeps the configured thread count.
`GET_ROWS` `src0` is exempt: it is the (possibly 27 GiB, host-resident) embedding table of which only the
gathered rows are read, and counting it would permanently disable the heuristic for the exact
host-resident-embedding spec-decode case 0028 was written for.  With the instrumented build the only
graphs still classified tiny on the reproduction are `GET_ROWS` (1 node, 20-164 KiB of output); the FFN
chunks (`nodes=4`, ~50 MB of inputs) take the pool.

**Gates.**  Greedy same-seed `llama-cli` on the offloaded-FFN config is byte-identical with the heuristic
on and off (the only `diff` is the timing line); `scripts/validate-set.sh` green.

## 2026-09-27 (r12) — block-06 amendment: op-offload H2D staging ring + tensor-split op-offload; block 06 renamed

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r12`** (canonical tip `de71ddd581f1becfee9d8e1ca99ba8ad0280b78c`, tree
`0702644390f557959766ec5832108f7757ba00e8`; `scripts/validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`,
applied tree == `release.json.tree`).  Only **block 06** changes content; blocks 07-15 move only their
`From <sha>`/`index` lines.

**Block 06 is renamed** from `host-buffer revert for discrete GPUs` (its original content lost its
purpose when upstream reverted #24233 in #28604, leaving it a rationale marker that had already been
repurposed as the delivery's catch-all) to **`general system-operations bucket`** — what it has actually
been since r6.  The old name was actively misleading.

**Promoted** `wip/h2d-staging-ring/` — now `archive/work/h2d-staging-ring/` (issue #50, the op-offload
H2D staging ring).  It merges **PR #51 by
@briansp2020**, whose contributions are load-bearing, not cosmetic: the **redirect design** (the
consuming op reads the ring slot and the pointer is restored at the next issue, so the staged bytes move
once instead of twice), `GGML_SCHED_EVENTS`, and the **tripwire** assert.  Our own arm was a D2D copy and
measured strictly worse (`MODE=0` costs 1.5-10.6 % on his link, ~3.5 % on ours), so the redirect is the
default.  He also independently reproduced the merged result on a third configuration (55 GB/s PCIe5
x16: +31-81 % across ub, same-seed purity `6cd450472487` across all three modes, 18/18 server requests)
and supplied the D2D numbers we could only estimate.  Credit for those elements belongs to him.

**The `-sm tensor` blocker was a misdiagnosis, and finding that out was the bulk of the work.**  The
report was "the ring is inert under `-sm tensor`", and the previous handover assumed the meta backend
could not stage.  In fact there were **no H2D weight uploads to overlap at all**: the meta device left
`offload_op` NULL, so `ggml_backend_sched_backend_id_from_cur()` could never select it for an
op-offloaded node and `-ncmoe` executed the whole MoE on the **CPU** (`GGML_SCHED_DEBUG=2` shows the
`MUL_MAT_ID` nodes on `CPU`; forcing that state with `GGML_OP_OFFLOAD_MIN_BATCH=1000000` reproduces the
reported 498.73 t/s).  Three fixes:

1. **`ggml_backend_meta_device_offload_op()`** — the meta device declares offload support when every
   simple device does.  The enabling fix.
2. **Mirrored tensors serve arbitrary byte ranges** (`ggml_backend_meta_set/get_tensor_async`).  Enabling
   op-offload lit up the scheduler's used-expert pruning, which uploads at a non-zero byte offset and
   reads the router's ids as a strided view's raw span (`blk.N.ffn_moe_topk`, `nb[1]=1024`); the
   `offset == 0` / `ggml_is_contiguous` assert pair aborted on both (core dump at
   `ggml-backend-meta.cpp`).  A `MIRRORED` tensor needs no chunk arithmetic, so its range is forwarded;
   the partial axes keep their asserts.
3. **Per-device staging** — a new `stage_input` hook plus the meta-side per-device ring, because under a
   tensor split one logical upload is N spliced chunks on N devices and the split's consumers read the
   per-device "simple" tensors, never the meta tensor's `data` (so the scheduler's redirect cannot reach
   them).

**Also fixed:** 15 backends' **positional `ggml_backend_i` initializers** omitted the new staging fields,
so adding them assigned each backend's `graph_optimize` into `stage_buffer` and NULLed `graph_optimize`
(metal/vulkan/hexagon/virtgpu lost their optimizer; metal's `stage_buffer` became a function pointer the
scheduler would call under `GGML_SCHED_STAGE=1`).  All 18 initializer lists are complete.

**Measured** (gfx1201, 2x R9700, 35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M, `-sm tensor -ncmoe 99 -fa 1`, pp8192):

| ub | MoE on CPU (pre-fix) | op-offload | + staging |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1024 | ~340 | 337.17 | 345.20 (gated) |
| 2048 | 508.42 | 620.27 | **715.71** |
| 4096 | - | 1092.56 | **1413.94** |
| 8192 | 523.06 | 1823.12 | **2741.56** |

`-ncmoe 10 -sm tensor` (host *and* device MoE layers) 1958.74 -> **2281.82**.  `-sm layer -ncmoe 99`
pp8192/ub8192 on the same box: 2708.21 -> **4111.14** - a tensor split replicates the expert weights
(their split state is `MIRRORED`), so it cannot match a layer split; the fix removes the CPU fallback, it
does not make tensor split the better way to serve `-ncmoe` (that is TODO item 26).

**Gate battery on the frozen patch** (the tree promoted here):

| gate | result |
|---|---|
| `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` / `-o MUL_MAT_ID` | 2/2 / 2/2 OK |
| width purity `W=1..8` (4B) | f16 PURE; q8_0 shows only the **documented** `{W=1}` vs `{W=2..8}` tile edge (issue #30 / `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §36); `GGML_SCHED_EVENTS=1` identical in both |
| greedy text, `-sm layer` / `-sm tensor`, staging 0 vs 1 | byte-identical (`f90525c438c4` / `0936c8318533`) |
| MTP `draft-mtp n3`, MoE + staging **active** | 4/4 identical `2a7439c54eb7`, acceptance 0.70612 stable |
| `-sm tensor` perplexity: CPU / op-offload / op-offload+staging | 14.4155 / 14.4657 / **14.4657** — staging is bit-identical, and op-offload is within the (+/-0.97) uncertainty of the CPU path |
| deep prefill (~32k prompt, `-ncmoe 99`, ub 2048) | pure `86b7f9b5aa80`, 1023 -> **1273 t/s (+24 %)** |
| concurrent server soak (3 x ~20k prompts x 6 rounds, ub 4096) | 18/18 both stages, clean logs, 246 -> **187 s (-24 %)** |

**Note for field reports:** `sched_stage_min_tokens` now also emits a one-line notice at WARN **when
`GGML_SCHED_STAGE` is set explicitly**, because ggml's `GGML_LOG_INFO` maps to TRACE verbosity (below
llama.cpp's default threshold) and `llama-bench` additionally installs `llama_null_log_callback` without
`-v`.  Reported by @briansp2020, who could not see the gate a host had chosen.

**Verification of the fold.**  The amended block 06 was constructed so that the final content is
byte-identical to (r11 + the WIP patch) **except one hunk**: `h2d_stage_free()` lands before rather than
after the `fattn_stage` loop in the `ggml_backend_cuda_context` destructor (independent frees; no
behavioural difference).  Verified by building both and re-running the `-sm tensor` purity gate
(`0936c8318533` in both) and the pp8192 bench (2731 vs 2742 t/s, within run noise).

**Follow-up.**  TODO item 24 is closed; **item 26** (splitting the expert weights under `-sm tensor`
instead of mirroring them) is picked up as a new WIP item.  The upstream-standalone half (fixes 1+2) is
staged as `upstream/UPSTREAM-PR-meta-offload-op.patch` and validated on pristine master
(505.49 -> 1690.26 t/s).

## 2026-09-26 (r11) — block-13 amendment: fix the MoE MMVQ `rpb` mis-launch (`MUL_MAT_ID`, `k == 3*qk`)

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r11`** (only `patches/0013` changes content; canonical tip
`080deacaa856f1ccaedad870af44c12af4cea2af`, tree `8355af9bb9d7aca7375ca4acc9f37041dc1c9b7a`;
`scripts/validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree == `release.json.tree`).

**Finding.** `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` fails at exactly
`n_mats=4, n_used=2, b=0, m=64, n=16, k∈{96,192,384,768}` — every quantized `type_a`, with
`ERR ≈ 0.43-0.53` against a `5e-4` tolerance — while `f32`/`f16`/`bf16` at the same shape pass.  It
reproduces on `main` and on the r9 delivery tree `b48fb3f68` with no other patch applied, so it is a
delivery bug, and the upstream test (added by `c74759a24`, present at the base `84e76d8a2`) is
legitimate.

**Root cause.** Block 13's `mul_mat_vec_q_moe_launch` sizes the grid from a per-shape row tile:
`rpb = min(ceil(8/blocks_per_row_x), 8)` for `blocks_per_row_x < 8`, where
`blocks_per_row_x = ncols_x / qk`.  For `blocks_per_row_x == 3` that is **3**, but the kernel is only
instantiated for RPB 2/4/8, so the `switch (rpb)` below falls through to its `default` and launches
**RPB 2** while `nblocks_rows` was computed with 3: the grid then covers only `2 × ceil(64/3) = 44` of
the 64 rows and the remaining 20 rows are never written.  `blocks_per_row_x == 3` is exactly
`k == 3*qk`, which is what every failing shape has (q8_0/q4_0/iq4_nl `k=96`, q2_0 `k=192`, a 128-block
type `k=384`, q4_K/q5_K/q6_K `k=768`).  The delivery's block-13 `MMVQ_MOE_MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 16` band is
what makes this test reach the MoE kernel at `n = 16` at all (upstream's per-type cap is 4-7 and sends
that width to MMQ), so the band **exposed** the latent mis-launch rather than causing it; the "band
off" kill-switch (`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MMVQ_MOE_BAND`) is what initially isolated it.

**Fix.** Snap `rpb` to a supported value (2) *before* sizing the grid, so `nblocks_rows` and the
launched kernel always agree, with the trap recorded in a comment.  No new kernel instantiations.

**Validation.** `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` **2/2 backends passed, OK** with the band on (default)
(only the legitimate `not supported` tq1_0/tq2_0 and huge-`amax` cases remain); `-o FLASH_ATTN_EXT`
still 2/2 OK; 35B-A3B Q4_K_M same-seed greedy text unchanged (`sha=e7e29d5a470a`, staging off *and*
on); `llama-batched-bench` `-npl 1,4,8` unchanged.  The fix is a literal no-op for any shape with
`blocks_per_row_x != 3` (the snapped value equals the old one), and real MoE geometries have
`blocks_per_row_x` 2 or ≥8, so no measured result moves.  Found while gating the issue-#50 staging ring
(`wip/h2d-staging-ring/`); `TODO.md` item 25 closes with this entry.

## 2026-09-26 (r10) — block-15 amendment: skip fully-masked KV groups in the FA prefill kernels (issue #48)

**Release `v16-84e76d8a2-r10`** (only `patches/0015` changed; canonical tip
`a788760f97aa26a364a8efbf67ec82a59c1147aa`, tree `b59faaddb700581718740c226cea71a115c6c178`;
`scripts/validate-set.sh` green, strict 16/16 `git am`).

**Issue.** [stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts#48](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/issues/48)
(reporter @DanoPTT, R9700 / gfx1201 / ROCm 10.0): with `-np 2 --kv-unified`, a concurrent
`/completion` prefill drops ~45 % against its single-stream rate.  The second request's ubatch attends
over the whole shared KV range, including the other slot's ~69 k cells; those are fully masked
(`-INF`) for this request, but the FA kernels still loaded and processed every one of their
`FATTN_KQ_STRIDE`-sized KV groups.  `flash_attn_mask_to_KV_max` only trims the **tail** and is gated
`Q->ne[1] >= 1024 || Q->ne[3] > 1` (so it is off at `-ub 512`); interior foreign blocks were never
removed.  Same root cause as upstream #28495, and **not** a delivery regression (a tree without any
skip shows the same drop).  The reporter carries a per-(Q tile, KV block) skip modelled on the closed
upstream PR #28943; this amendment is the delivery's own design and folds it into block 15, which owns
the V3 derived kq mask.

**Why it is bit-identical.**  A fully-masked KV group contributes `exp(-inf - max) = 0` to the online
softmax, leaves `KQ_max` unchanged and adds exact zeros to `KQ_rowsum`/`VKQ`; skipping it only removes
no-op iterations, so the remaining blocks accumulate in the same order.  A group is only marked when
**every** mask entry of **every** query row it is classified against is `-INF`.

**Fix.**  One `kq_blocks` bitmap argument (new in the shared `fattn_kernel_t`) feeds the MMA and tile
kernels, which skip marked groups with `fattn_kq_group_masked()` in the ordinary and stream-k prefill
paths.  Two producers fill it, because a unified KV cache reaches the kernels two ways:

* **derived mask** (single-sequence prefill, the server-slot default): the per-cell visibility is
already published on the host (`cell_pos`/`tok_lo`/`tok_hi`), so `launch_fattn` classifies each
  256-cell group into a **batch-wide** bitmap (`flash_attn_kq_derived_blocks`).  The window is the
  batch union; it is conservative for a multi-tile batch.
* **packed mask** (multi-sequence prefill — continuous batching routinely puts more than one sequence
  in a ubatch, and `kq_mask_derivable()` rejects that shape): different rows of one query tile can
  belong to different sequences, so a batch-wide test cannot work.  A GPU prepass scans the packed
  mask and emits one bit per **(Q stream, query tile, 256-cell group)**
  (`flash_attn_mask_to_KV_blocks`), handling multi-stream, ALiBi and M-RoPE masks uniformly because it
  classifies the actual mask values.

The kernels tell the layouts apart by `mask == nullptr` (derived = batch-wide, packed = per tile).
The decode/verify band (`Q->ne[1] <= 8`) is deliberately untouched: the packed skip is gated to
`Q->ne[1] > 8`, so the band's tuned round-robin KV split and its width-purity invariant are unchanged.
`GGML_CUDA_FA_MASK_SKIP=0` is the A/B kill-switch (default on).

**Validation (gfx1201 unless noted).**

* `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT`: **6354/6354** on the WMMA/MMA path and **6354/6354** with the
tile path forced (`GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_256=0`).  New deterministic cases cover a contiguous interior
hole on the derived path (`derived_hole`, kv 4096, incl. the `n_q = 9..16` wide-verify band), a
contiguous interior `-INF` block on the packed path (`mask_hole`, also multi-stream `nr23[1]=2` and
ALiBi `max_bias=8`), and an odd query count; before this the random-mask cases planted only 128×64
`-INF` blocks, far smaller than a 256-cell group, so the packed skip was never exercised.  With the
env-gated diagnostic the packed prepass marked groups in **150** calls and every case still passed
against the CPU oracle.
* `-kvu` multi-sequence prefill (`llama-batched-bench -npp 8192 -ntg 1 -npl 1,4 -ub 512`, 4B Q8_0):
  `S_PP` 7254/5737 (skip off) -> 7280/6991 (skip on), **+21.9 % at B=4**; with the tile kernel forced
  5808/3270 -> 5838/5642, **+72.5 %**.  (The `-kvu` drop is flat vs `-no-kvu` after the fix.)
* Concurrent server A/B (two ~10.5 k-token `/completion` requests, `-np 2 --kv-unified
  --no-cache-idle-slots -b 1024 -ub 512`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_GRAPHS=1`, median of 3): total prefill
  **4190 -> 3872 ms (-7.6 %)** on MMA and **6276 -> 4961 ms (-21 %)** with the tile kernel forced.
* Single-stream prefill is unchanged (within noise): `llama-bench -p 512,4096,16384` 8049/7581/6745 ->
  8121/7612/6771 t/s.
* **MTP** (Qwen3.8-27B Q8_0 built-in nextn head, 2-GPU `-sm tensor`, `-n 1000`, prose prompt):
  `draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3` acceptance **0.59331 both** and 58.0 t/s both;
  `draft-mtp-adaptive --spec-draft-n-max 7` acceptance **0.58129 both** and 57.4 t/s both; `none`
  30.1/30.2 t/s.  The generated text is byte-identical (`sha=832aed3d869d`, 3871 chars) across
  `{none, draft-mtp} x {skip 0, 1}`.  `ngram-mod` speculation on the 4B is likewise byte-identical and
  flat (~92.5 t/s).

**Left as follow-up.**  The skip is prefill-only; a unified-cache **decode** with N concurrent slots
still pays for the other slots' cells every step (the packed prepass would cost O(n_q*n_kv) per step).
That is a separate optimization with its own band-purity gate.

## 2026-09-26 (repo hygiene) — `wip/` consolidation: every campaign except `nwarps/` archived

**Not a delivery change** — no patch, no `release.json` hash, no runtime behaviour touched.  Every
campaign tree under `wip/` except **`nwarps/`** (the per-M `nwarps` width-purity impurity, the one
item deliberately left open) was closed and moved to `archive/work/`:

* the two 2026-09-26 kernel campaigns — **`per16-f16-mma`** (parked: the per-16→F16 route's ceiling is
the int8 MMQ, not hipBLAS) and **`mmq-pipeline`** (closed **negative**: the MMQ software pipeline is
15-18 % slower at equal geometry, and the `I=64` geometry it needs is ~21 % slower — the kernel is
per-element-epilogue/`ldmatrix` bound, not global-load/barrier bound);
* the previously-completed trees — `beta-integration`, `bf16-native-prefill` (closed negative),
  `build-time-regression` (fixed), `closing-the-gap` (consolidated into `archive/work/mmb-general/`),
  `issue-30-mtp-decode-regression`, `issue-44-hc-combine-oracle`, `issue-45-band-port`,
  `kq-derived-tile`, `kq-mask-derived-ab`, `mtp-journey-2026-09-17`;
* the dormant scoping records — `prefill-arrangements`, `q8-prefill-tuning`, `reasoning-aware-mtp`,
  `tiled-gdn`.

`per16-f16-mma` and `mmq-pipeline` existed only on `wip/*` branches; their content was materialised
into `archive/work/` and the branches retired.  Cross-references in tracked docs were rewritten
(`wip/<x>` → `archive/work/<x>`); verbatim profiler logs/CSVs under the moved trees keep the old
absolute paths.  `wip/` now contains a single tree (`nwarps/`).

The same consolidation also moved the top-level **`beta/mmb-general/` record to
`archive/work/mmb-general/`** (the mmb/qsa3/indexer campaign has been folded into the 16 delivery
blocks since `v16-84e76d8a2-r8` and is no longer applied separately — `apply-beta.sh` was already
removed), so `main` no longer carries a `beta/` directory.  The redundant `beta-integration` branch
(fully contained in `main`) was retired.  See `archive/README.md`.

## 2026-09-26 (r9) — block-15 amendment: restore the typed non-swizzled K/V store in the MMA FA loader (issue #47)

**Issue.**  [stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts#47](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/issues/47)
(reporter @briansp2020, gfx1201 / ROCm 10.0): prefill on the `84e76d8a2` base is 2-6 % slower than
`v16-ebbb18522-r11`, traced to the upstream FA smem-swizzle refactor `1884824fd` (PR #28536).  That
commit collapsed `swz_K`/`swz_V` into one `swz` and replaced the generic K/V loader's guarded store

```c
if constexpr (swz) { *(char *)… } else { tile_KV + i*stride_tile + k*4; }
```

with an unconditional byte-pointer form `ggml_cuda_memcpy_1<16>((char *) tile_KV + swizzle_bytes<swz, half2>(…), src)`.
On every AMD target `swz` is **false** (swizzling is `turing_mma_available()`-gated), so the layout is
unchanged — but the `char *` arithmetic drops the `half2` alignment and HIP then splits the 16-byte
shared-memory store (the reporter's ISA guess; the address is identical either way).  The delivery's two
block-15 native loaders (V4/V5) had kept the `if constexpr (swz) … else typed` guard through the
re-base; only the upstream generic loader lost it.

**Fix.**  One block-15 hunk in `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn-mma-f16.cuh`
`flash_attn_ext_f16_load_tile()`'s non-`cp_async` arm: restore the typed store under `if constexpr (!swz)`
(the address is `tile_KV + i*stride_tile + k*h2_per_chunk`, bit-identical to the byte form).  Only
`patches/0015-…` changed.  All four `swizzle_bytes` sites were re-audited: sites 473/553 (native
loaders) were already guarded, site 641 is the `cp_async_cg_16` arm — unreachable on AMD
(`cp_async_available()` is NVIDIA Ampere+) and a shared-space `unsigned int` dst, so no typed form
applies — and site 687 is the one fixed here.  Every other `(char *)` store in `ggml-cuda` is VRAM or a
composite global offset; the `mma.cuh` `swizzle()` helpers return `const T *` and the `load_ldmatrix`
family already branches to the typed path for `!swz`.

**Canonical chain.**  `beta-integration` block-15 amended in `~/llama-integration`; regenerated
patches (only `0015` differs) and `release.json`.  New tip `b48fb3f686fe2681f55aa406a8ed52313ad80875`,
tree `a3dc4bbb680bf9dd8bcb5949ec833dec2a892aeb`, release `v16-84e76d8a2-r9`.
`scripts/validate-set.sh` green (checksums, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree == `a3dc4bbb…`).

**Performance (gfx1201, ROCm 7.14.1, one R9700, pre-fix vs post-fix same tree).**
- `test-backend-ops perf -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT`, `hsk=256` f16: `nr23=[4,1]` kv 4096 nb 4096
  10780 -> 10046 us (**+6.8 %**); `nr23=[8,1]` kv 4096 nb 4096 21046 -> 20269 (**+3.7 %**);
  `nr23=[4,1]` kv 16384 nb 256 2687 -> 2504 (**+6.8 %**); kv 16384/65536 within 1.8-2.4 %.
- 4B Q8_0, `llama-bench` pp20480 `-ub 2048` 7045 -> 7204 t/s (**+2.3 %**); pp512/2048/8192 within
  0.4-0.8 % (shorter prefills hide the store cost), tg128 flat (95.34 -> 95.47).
- **Reporter's exact model**, `Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q4_K_XL` (gqa 6, head 256), 1 GPU: f16 KV
  pp4096 @ d16000 1094.9 -> 1109.4 t/s (**+1.3 %**); q8_0 KV pp4096 @ d40000 872.6 -> 911.3 t/s
  (**+4.4 %**) — the reporter measured 885.5 -> 922.0 (+4.1 %) on the same shape.

**Purity (the change is a store-address form, so this is the no-regression gate).**
- `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT -b ROCm0` **6340/6340**.
- `test-logits-width-probe` 4B, W=1..8, `RS=from_w` f16 + q8_0: `width_purity=PASS` (worst maxdiff 0)
  and **every W/row hash identical pre- vs post-fix** (`W=1` f16 `0c5a92a62393f2a1`, q8_0
  `fcc6041324f63857`).
- Text gate (`prompts/code-python.txt`, seed 42, temp 0, `-n 64`) on the reporter's 27B: plain /
  `draft-mtp` n3 / n7 x f16 / q8_0 all **`818 chars sha=336bb8dcfbf3`**, identical pre- vs post-fix;
  4B plain `753 chars sha=c125609eb012` identical (the 4B carries no MTP head).

## 2026-09-25 (r8) — the folded `mmb`/QSA campaign is promoted to `main`

**Promotion.**  `beta-integration` was merged into `main` (merge commit) and cut as release
**`v16-84e76d8a2-r8`**.  The rename from the branch's working label `…-r8-integrated` to the release
tag `v16-84e76d8a2-r8` is forced by CI: `.github/workflows/docker-ghcr.yml` requires a tag of the
form `v16-<base>-r<N>` and refuses anything else, so the annotated tag is `v16-84e76d8a2-r8`.
`main` now carries the same canonical 16-block chain (tip `f373450de…`, tree `24bb0f5acb…`) the
branch was validated at; the "integrated" distinction is historical only.

**Gate.**  `scripts/validate-set.sh` reran green on the promoted tree (checksums + strict 16/16
`git am` + applied tree == `24bb0f5acb…`).  No patch body changed — every artifact sha256 is
unchanged from the branch, only `release.json.release` and the docs moved.  Docs swept to the
promoted state (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `BASELINE.md`, `MANIFESTS.md`, `TODO.md`,
`patches/README.md`): the current-state headers now name `main` / `v16-84e76d8a2-r8` instead of the
`beta-integration` branch / release candidate.

**Next.**  Pushing `main` and the `v16-84e76d8a2-r8` tag triggers the full ROCm release pipeline
(GHCR images for ROCm 7.2/7.14/10.0 + the GitHub Release with the packaged patch set).

## 2026-09-25 (`beta-integration`) — the 28 `archive/work/mmb-general` patches are folded into the 16 delivery blocks

**Branch** `beta-integration` (cut from `main` at `0699a3d`).  The delivery is now the **16 amended
patches**: applying them to `84e76d8a2` reproduces the former 28-patch beta campaign tree
**`24bb0f5acb3e866abd4cad8c0de1bad45a20cb47`** exactly.  Canonical tip
`f373450de489dd0fafba5bd285e71844109cd0ec`, release candidate `v16-84e76d8a2-r8`.
`main` still carries the un-integrated `v16-84e76d8a2-r7` delivery + the separate beta set.

**Why.**  The beta campaign had served its beta window (gfx1151 re-validation GREEN, gfx1201/gfx1100
ported and gated).  The maintainer asked for the patches to be absorbed into the block set rather
than kept as a separate opt-in layer, and for the docs to be swept to match (the `apply-beta.sh`
helper was removed).

**Method.**  A fresh linear rebuild in `~/llama-integration` (branch `beta-integration`): each of the
16 delivery block commits was cherry-picked onto `84e76d8a2`, the mapped beta patches were folded
into it with `git cherry-pick -n`, and the conflicts were resolved to the net final content.  The
final `git diff` against `mmb-beta` is empty.

**Fold mapping.**  block 06 (catch-all) <- 0025/0028; block 08 (prefill/MMB) <- 0001/0003/0006-0010/
0012/0014/0015; block 13 <- the MMB stand-down of the swiglu->mmq fusion; block 14 <- the MMB
pair-fusion stand-down + 0027 (MMVQ band); block 15 (campaign memory/attention) <- 0002/0003-qwen4exp/
0004/0005/0008/0011/0013/0016-0024/0026.  The qwen4exp/QSA/HC/indexer group lands in block 15 (not 14)
because block 15 owns the intervening `qwen4exp.cpp`/`ggml-cuda.cu` code the beta series was authored
against; the alternative is per-hunk splits with a less clean intermediate history (recorded in
`archive/work/beta-integration/integration.md` as the open review question).

**Validation.**
- Rebuilt tip tree == `mmb-beta` tree (`24bb0f5acb…`); `git diff` empty.
- Fresh `84e76d8a2` + strict `git am` of the 16 regenerated patches -> tree `24bb0f5acb…` (16/16).
- `scripts/validate-set.sh` PASS (checksums + strict apply + tree/count).
- gfx1201 `~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714` EXIT 0.
- Runtime gates were not re-run individually: the tree is byte-identical to the already-validated beta
  tree, so the campaign's gfx1151/gfx1201/gfx1100 gate records carry over unchanged.

**Artifacts.**  `patches/` (16 regenerated), `rdna-boosts-all.patch`, `release.json`
(`v16-84e76d8a2-r8`, tip `f373450de…`, tree `24bb0f5acb…`).  Docs swept: `README.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, `MANIFESTS.md`, `BASELINE.md`, `TODO.md`, `patches/README.md`, and the
`archive/work/mmb-general/` banner; `scripts/apply-beta.sh` removed.

**Defaults.**  The folded campaign was default-ON in the beta set, so the folded delivery is too
(`GGML_CUDA_MMB` defaults to 1 and `=0` disables, etc.).  The env kill-switches are unchanged -
see `archive/work/mmb-general/BETA-TESTING.md` §0/§3.

## 2026-09-25 (r7) — `v16-84e76d8a2-r7`: the multi-device scheduler race gate learns the Meta tensor-split backend (block 14)

**Release** `v16-84e76d8a2-r7`, base `84e76d8a2` (tree `5112eedbce0548ab9547d883e8aa54e993852e94`),
tip `596a22dbfbde571728e93acf986a02200aaf46ee`, net tree
`7726e514284ea7393bb9097ce305dc5b6dacdb11`.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green on a fresh `84e76d8a2`
tarball (strict **16/16** `git am`).  Only block 14 changed.

**Reported.**  A long-running 3-GPU `-sm tensor` llama-server (qwen4exp IQ4_XS,
`--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive,ngram-mod`, `-ctk/-ctv q8_0`, `--no-kv-unified`,
`--ctx-checkpoints 64`) died intermittently (~1 in 10) at a task boundary with a **memory fault in
`quantize_q8_1` on GPU 2**.

**Root cause.**  Block 14's cross-GPU race guard in `ggml_backend_sched_alloc_splits` counts the
scheduler's non-CPU *backends* to decide whether the no-sync gallocr re-reserve path is safe.  Under
`-sm tensor` on >1 device, upstream's tensor-parallel **Meta device** (`llama_prepare_model_devices`)
wraps all GPUs into a single `GGML_BACKEND_DEVICE_TYPE_META` device, so the scheduler holds
`[Meta, CPU]` and the count is `1` - the guard never fires.  The Meta backend runs each device's
subgraph asynchronously on a separate stream (`ggml_backend_meta_graph_compute` ->
`ggml_backend_graph_compute_async`), so the re-reserve re-points tensor addresses while the previous
ubatch's kernels are still in flight on the other GPUs: the documented cross-GPU race (the same
`quantize_q8_1` fault the 2026-09-06 gating fix addressed, which predated the Meta device).

**The change (block 14, `ggml/src/ggml-backend.cpp`).**  A Meta backend is treated as multi-device:
the device-count loop sets `multi_device = true` for a `GGML_BACKEND_DEVICE_TYPE_META` backend, and the
full-sync path is taken when `buffers_grown || n_async_devices > 1 || multi_device`.  A Meta device is
only ever created for >1 device, so this restores the multi-GPU synchronization without touching the
validated single-device / one-GPU+CPU fast path (and `-sm layer`, which uses per-device backends, is
unchanged).

**Validation.**  `scripts/validate-set.sh` strict 16/16, applied tree == `7726e514…`.  3-GPU
`-sm tensor` coherence (4B Q8_0) clean; `llama-bench -sm tensor -ctk/-ctv q8_0 -ub 2048` at
pp512/pp8192/tg128 stable over 3 runs (pp8192 ~10.75k t/s, tg128 ~102 t/s) with no fault or hang.
The 28-patch `archive/work/mmb-general` set is re-cut onto r7 (strict 28/28, applied tree `24bb0f5acb…`,
patch bodies byte-identical - the beta touches `ggml-backend.cpp` only at lines ~1043-1078 and
~1462-1463, far from the fix).

## 2026-09-25 (r6) — `v16-84e76d8a2-r6`: bf16 native K/V staging is on by default (block 15)

**Release** `v16-84e76d8a2-r6`, base `84e76d8a2` (tree `5112eedbce0548ab9547d883e8aa54e993852e94`),
tip `b3c3051a72df21f600f5ae13b244c8212210ca2e`, net tree
`504894e61e17c6616b54871abee9fb23beda38bd`.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green on a fresh `84e76d8a2`
tarball (strict **16/16** `git am`).  Only block 15 changed; blocks 00-14 are byte-identical.

**The change.**  `ggml_cuda_fattn_kv_native_bf16_enabled()` now returns `policy != OFF` instead of
`policy == ON`, so `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE` unset (auto) enables the bf16 native arm exactly like the
q8_0/q4_0/Q4_1/Q5_0/Q5_1/iq4_nl arms; `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE=0` disables them all (the single
existing kill-switch), `=1` forces all on.  One line of policy plus its comment.

**Why.**  The V5 bf16 native arm was left opt-in on 2026-09-15 with the reasoning "it only removes the
MMA scratch, at ~1-2 % prefill with no equivalent decode win".  r5 removed the second half: the band
gate follows `ggml_cuda_fattn_kv_native_type`, so native bf16 is what puts a bf16 cache on the RDNA4
GQA-6 decode/verify band.  Maintainer call (2026-09-25): the beta prefill boosts being integrated soon
easily outweigh the small prefill cost, so bf16 gets the same treatment as the other types.

**Measured (gfx1201 R9700, 27B qwen35 head 256 GQA 6, `test-backend-ops perf` @ kv 16384, bf16 KV,
us/run).**  Default (band) 145/164/264/285 at `n_q` 1/3/5/8 vs `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE=0` (staged
tile) 104/276/428/655 -- the default is 1.5-2.3x faster at every verify width, and the `n_q = 1` cost
(+40 %) is the same trade f16 already pays.  End to end, 27B UD-Q4_K_XL `draft-mtp` n3 at ~30k ctx,
1 GPU: default **56.1 t/s** vs `=0` **49.3 t/s** (the opt-in arm, now the default); prefill flat
(1026.7/1024.4 vs 1021.2/1021.5 t/s).

**Purity.**  `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **6340/6340 on ROCm0**; bf16 `--spec-type none ==
draft-mtp` byte-identical at ~5k (`904d905c8c29`) and ~30k (`d515c9f933ea`).

**Beta re-base.**  The 28 `archive/work/mmb-general` patches were re-cut onto r6 (strict **28/28** on a fresh
delivery, applied tree **`1df5769c…`**, previously `469082e4…` on r5).  The patch bodies are
byte-identical to the r5-based set - only the `From <sha>` lines and `commits.txt` changed.

## 2026-09-25 (r5) — `v16-84e76d8a2-r5`: f16 (and bf16) on the RDNA4 GQA-6 FA band (block 15, issue #45 follow-up)

**Release** `v16-84e76d8a2-r5`, base `84e76d8a2` (tree `5112eedbce0548ab9547d883e8aa54e993852e94`),
tip `62eaaec3e41bbefeda2f3625ecd6e6f7e814e2f0`, net tree
`de86c5e11f8dbebedec42be16c00cda7f68853a2`.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green on a fresh `84e76d8a2`
tarball (strict **16/16** `git am`).  Folded into block 15 (the band's home, r4); blocks 00-14 are
byte-identical and only `patches/0015` changes.

**The report (issue #45 comment, @DanoPTT).**  r4's band is quantized-KV-only: f16 has no native read
(`ggml_cuda_fattn_kv_native_type == NONE`), so `ggml_cuda_fattn_band_wmma_applies` kept it on the tile
kernel.  But the F1 purity pin (`fattn-tile.cuh`, block 08: `cols_per_block = ncols2 > 2 ? ncols2 : 2`)
makes the whole `n_q <= 8` band use the `n_q = 1` tile config, and at GQA 6 with `ncols2 = 2` every
query row re-reads and re-stages every K/V element three times.  On gfx1201, f16 kv 102400: `n_q = 1`
reads ~604 GB/s but `n_q = 4` only ~180 GB/s, so the verify width is ~50 % slower than an older tree
that used a wider tile config (and was not width-pure).  The reporter asked whether the band could
cover f16/bf16.

**The fix.**  The band gate now also accepts f16 (K and V both `GGML_TYPE_F16`); the native-quantized
set is unchanged.  bf16 already reaches the band through its opt-in native arm (`kv_native == BF16`)
and is deliberately **not** banded while staged, where the whole-cache conversion dominates (measured
3x the tile cost).  The band's config is now chosen per K/V element size because the two classes have
different optima:

* **native-quantized** (`q8_0`/`q4_0`/`q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1`/`iq4_nl`): `ncols1 = 4`, `P = nsm`
  (**unchanged r4 tuning**; dequantization dominates and hides the columns an `n_q = 1` decode leaves
  unused).
* **2-byte** (`f16`, and bf16 when native): `ncols1 = 2`, `P = max(2, 3*nsm/4)` (24 on this `nsm` 32
  device).  With no dequantization the unused columns are a large fraction of the `n_q = 1` cost, and
  the lighter per-iteration work makes the `P`-partials fixup dominate, so a smaller `P` wins.

`ggml_cuda_fattn_band_wmma_applies` is still shared by the chooser, the ncols dispatcher and
`launch_fattn`; the helpers now take the op tensor so they can key off `K->type`. 
`GGML_HIP_FA_BAND_WMMA` (0 off, 2/4 force ncols1) and `GGML_HIP_FA_BAND_WMMA_SPLIT` still override.  `P`
is still independent of `n_q` and the KV length, so the round-robin split keeps the GREEDY-PURITY band
invariant (one config per K/V type for the whole band).

**Measurements (gfx1201 R9700, 27B qwen35 head 256 GQA 6, f16 KV).**  Op level, graph exported at kv
102400, `test-backend-ops perf --test-file`, tile (band off) -> band, us/run: `n_q` 1 678 -> 744,
3 1802 -> 848, 4 2230 -> 811, 8 3979 -> 1249 (**2.1-3.2x** at every verify width).  Built-in perf at
kv 16384: 1 94 -> 119, 3 246 -> 141, 5 393 -> 224, 8 603 -> 241.  End to end, 27B UD-Q4_K_XL
`draft-mtp` n3, 1 GPU, `-n 256`: ~30k ctx 48.9 -> 55.4 t/s (**+13 %**), ~5k ctx 58.2 -> 57.8 (flat);
plain decode (`--spec-type none`) 28.5 -> 27.8 (~5k, -2.5 %) and 26.1 -> 25.0 (~30k, -4.2 %).  bf16 with
its native arm on (`GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE=1`), same deep shape: 49.3 -> 56.0 t/s (**+14 %**), prefill
flat (1023 vs 1023 t/s at ~30k); the bf16 native default is left opt-in in r5 (its prefill trade is
unchanged), then **flipped ON in r6** (2026-09-25) once the maintainer weighted the incoming beta
prefill boosts against it.

**Purity.**  `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **6340/6340 on ROCm0** (the 389-case qwen35 subset is
green on the final build); f16 `--spec-type none == draft-mtp` byte-identical at ~5k (`3c31df680ac1`)
and ~30k (`32f533498f84`), q8_0 identical at ~5k (`50ca5b987f85`).  The quantized band is unregressed
(op level within noise: q8_0 kv 16384 147/148/222/227 -> 150/152/227/232 us).

**Beta re-base.**  The 28 `archive/work/mmb-general` patches were re-cut onto r5 (strict **28/28** on a fresh
delivery, applied tree **`469082e4…`**, previously `70cc895a…`).  The patch bodies are byte-identical to
the r4-based set - only their `From <sha>` lines and `commits.txt` changed - so the measured
gfx1201/gfx1100 beta behaviour carries over; `scripts/apply-beta.sh`'s recorded tree is updated.  The
gfx1151 four-gate re-validation on `469082e4` remains pending (as it was on `70cc895a`).

## 2026-09-25 (r4) — `v16-84e76d8a2-r4`: the RDNA4 GQA-6 decode/verify FA band (block 15, issue #45)

**Release** `v16-84e76d8a2-r4`, base `84e76d8a2` (tree `5112eedbce0548ab9547d883e8aa54e993852e94`),
tip `f744c11e6ee452d7cdc2786a9b9290b62c8fc5be`, net tree
`5938da09d294a01e0862c2d561b0c7ca154de90a`.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green on a fresh `84e76d8a2`
tarball (strict **16/16** `git am`).  Folded into block 15 (no new block), because the band fast path
uses the block's native-KV descriptor and derived-mask symbols; block 15 is the tip, so no later block
is disturbed.

**The bug (issue #45, reported by @overdoingism).**  At head 256 with GQA 6 (Qwen3.8-27B: 24 Q / 4 KV
heads) the tile kernel can only fold `ncols2 = 2`, because its `ncols2` must divide the GQA ratio, so
the whole `n_q <= 8` decode/verify band fetched and dequantized every K/V element once per head pair —
three times per query row.  On gfx1201 a q8_0 cache at `n_q = 1`, kv 102400 reads K/V at ~276 GB/s
versus ~615 GB/s for f16, i.e. the path is instruction-issue bound, and the fused fold is the fix.

**The fix.**  The whole band (`n_q = 1` included) now routes to the existing WMMA instances
`(256, ncols1 4|2, ncols2 8)` with the GQA group folded (2 masked columns at GQA 6); no new
instantiations.  The KV is split round-robin over a fixed `P = nsm` blocks per output tile
(`launch_fattn`, `GGML_HIP_FA_BAND_WMMA_SPLIT` override).  `P` depends on neither `n_q` nor the KV
length, so decode and every verify width accumulate the same partials in the same order — the
round-robin form is what keeps the GREEDY-PURITY band invariant; the reporter's first, contiguous
stream-k version moved its split points with the 256-padded KV length and diverged at KV position
18944 = 74×256.  The kernel chooser, the ncols dispatcher and `launch_fattn` share one self-contained
predicate (`ggml_cuda_fattn_band_wmma_applies`), and `launch_fattn` also requires the `ncols2 == 8`
template parameter, so a disagreement can never launch the 2-D grid into a kernel whose fast path is
compiled out.  Coverage follows `ggml_cuda_fattn_kv_native_type` rather than a hand-written type list,
so it is not q8_0-only: **q8_0, q4_0, q4_1, q5_0, q5_1 and iq4_nl all win** (f16 is DRAM-bound and has
no native read; bf16 stays on tile while its native arm is opt-in).  Default **ON** (maintainer
policy); `GGML_HIP_FA_BAND_WMMA=0` opts out, `=2` picks `ncols1 = 2`; `GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_256=0` and
`GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_MAX_HEAD<256` still disable it, exactly like the generic head>128 WMMA band.

**Measurements (gfx1201 R9700, 27B qwen35 head 256 GQA 6, q8_0 KV, kv 16384, `test-backend-ops perf`,
tile -> band µs/run):** `n_q` 3 326 -> 150, `n_q` 5 524 -> 225, `n_q` 8 814 -> 230; `n_q` 1 141 -> 148
(q4_0/q4_1/iq4_nl are *faster* at `n_q` 1 too; q5_1 is +11 %).  End to end, 27B UD-Q4_K_XL
`draft-mtp` n3 at ~40k ctx, band off -> on: 1 GPU layer 43.3 -> 51.3, 2 GPU tensor 67.9 -> 76.6, 3 GPU
tensor 77.6 -> 88.8 t/s (**+13-18 %**).  Prefill is flat: `llama-bench` pp512/2048/4096 2049/2060/2056
vs 2056/2059/2054 t/s (3-GPU tensor, q8_0), because the band is gated to `n_q <= 8` by construction.

**Purity (band on).**  `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **6340/6340 on ROCm0**, including 389 new
qwen35 GQA-6 cases across all eight KV types and both layouts; `plain == draft-mtp` byte-identical on
all eight KV types at ~40k ctx, 3-GPU tensor (acceptance 0.83-0.86); q8_0/q4_0 text identical across
`--spec-draft-n-max 3/5/7` (verify widths 4/6/8); 1 GPU layer, 2/3 GPU tensor (including the uneven
4-KV-head 2/1/1 split) and 3 GPU layer are all pure.  New qwen35-band eval and perf cases live in
`tests/test-backend-ops.cpp`.

## 2026-09-25 (r3) — `v16-84e76d8a2-r3`: the qwen4exp HC_COMBINE CPU-reference fix (block 14, issue #44) + beta re-base

**Release** `v16-84e76d8a2-r3`, base `84e76d8a2` (tree `5112eedbce0548ab9547d883e8aa54e993852e94`),
canonical block-15 tip `9d094a3c3a5013396596f862630a15ff24701b38`, net tree
`08fe2b77c5f79d69225c11fc293d452f4503cffd`.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green on a fresh `84e76d8a2`
tarball (strict **16/16** `git am`).  Folded into block 14 (no new block), because it is the last block
owned by the fused HC ops and no later block depends on the change.

**The bug (issue #44).**  `ggml_compute_forward_hc_combine_f32` (the CPU reference for the fused
qwen4exp hyper-connection residual combine) computed `block_out`'s row stride as `ne[1]` and indexed
`inject` as `c + t*hc`.  But `build_hc_combine` hands `block_out` over as a contiguous `[n_embd, nt]`
(so its row stride is `ne[0]`, not `nt`) and `inject` over as a strided **view** into the mix output
whose row stride is `n_embd + hc`.  Every token `t >= 1` therefore read the wrong rows; `nt == 1` was
accidentally correct.  A CPU-resident qwen4exp decoder layer (`-ngl` below the full decoder count, a
short prompt -> the hybrid memory splits the prefill into `nt <= HC_FUSED_MAX_TOKENS = 8` ubatches)
emitted EOS as its first generated token.  The reporter's root cause is exact: the CUDA kernel
(`ggml_cuda_op_hc_combine`) was already stride-aware, the CPU reference was not.

**The fix.**  The CPU reference now uses each tensor's own `nb[1]` row step, 0 for a broadcast
`ne[1] == 1`, exactly mirroring the CUDA kernel.  `nt == 1` (decode) is bit-identical.

**Validation (gfx1100).**  A standalone op-level oracle (`archive/work/issue-44-hc-combine-oracle/hctest.cpp`,
links `ggml`/`ggml-cpu`/`ggml-hip`) builds `GGML_OP_HC_COMBINE` with the real layouts (`block_out`
contiguous `[n_embd, nt]`, `inject` a view with row stride `n_embd+hc`), runs CPU and HIP, and
compares both to a host reference: **pre-fix 7 of 8 cases FAIL on CPU (nt = 2/4/7 and the broadcast
variants, up to 1.06 max abs diff) while HIP is exact; post-fix 8/8 PASS.**  The nt = 1 case passes
both.  Delivery full rebuild (`~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714`) succeeds; `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` coherence
smoke clean.  No qwen4exp model is present on the gfx1100 box (the large Flash-Next does not fit one
24 GB card), so the end-to-end model path was not runnable; the op oracle covers the exact defective
arithmetic.

**Beta re-base + gfx1100 routed-band fix.**  The 28 `archive/work/mmb-general` patches were re-based onto r3
(`git am` strict **28/28** on a fresh delivery, applied tree **`0daefe22…`**, previously `e00275ff…`).
The first gfx1100 beta-window run found a real regression in patch 0027: the extended 16-wide routed
`mul_mat_vec_q_moe` band (`MMVQ_MOE_MAX_BATCH_SIZE`) was enabled on RDNA3_0 (the `0031` arch floor
only split out RDNA3_5), and `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` failed **23/929** cases on gfx1100 (all
`n = 16`, every routed type/K) - the campaign's own note had left gfx1100 "still open".  Patch 0027
now floors the RDNA3 band at `MMVQ_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (8) for both RDNA3_0 and RDNA3_5, so the 16-wide
band is RDNA4-only; `MUL_MAT_ID` is **929/929** on gfx1100 (MMB on and off) and the width probe is
`width_purity=PASS (worst maxdiff 0)`.  gfx1100 beta sanity: `MMB_CFG cc=0x1001100 … f32split=0
routed=1`, MMB prefill **+18 % pp2048 / +17 % pp8192** (4B Q8_0), `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 26/26,
`GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46.  The gfx1151 four-gate re-validation remains GREEN on r2 and must be re-run
on r3.

## 2026-09-25 (r2) — `v16-84e76d8a2-r2`: the wide-VDR MoE expert leak fixed (block 10)

**Release** `v16-84e76d8a2-r2`, base `84e76d8a2` (tree `5112eedbce0548ab9547d883e8aa54e993852e94`),
canonical block-15 tip `6d420c5257c822d1606f9a5982297524198fd021`, net tree
`ea7acf2d3e18b0da01e00a3fcce0d770c430fa98`.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green on a fresh `84e76d8a2`
tarball (strict **16/16** `git am`).

**The bug.**  The 2026-09-25 beta-window re-validation (`archive/work/mmb-general/BETA-TESTING.md` §8)
measured the base-16 MoE `draft-mtp n3` acceptance at 0.73967 vs upstream's 0.78844 and attributed it
to a MoE reduction-order "accepted trade".  That was premature.  The cause was concrete: in block 10,
`VDR_Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K_Q8_1_MMVQ_MOE` were unconditional (4/4/2) while **only the Q8_0** MoE VDR carried
the `#if defined(RDNA4) || defined(RDNA3_0)` gate, whose comment says RDNA3_5 (gfx115x) "keeps VDR=2
pending verification".  On gfx1151 the Q4_K/Q6_K experts (the Q4_K_M expert types) therefore ran the
wide VDR=4 chunk the comment reserved for RDNA4/RDNA3_0, and the fused-MoE kill-switches / beta mmvq
bands could not see it because they do not touch `mul_mat_vec_q_moe`'s compile-time `vec_dot`/`vdr`.

**The fix.**  `get_vec_dot_q_cuda()` and `get_vdr_mmvq()` now ignore `moe` on every target that is not
RDNA4/RDNA3_0 - one gate (`GGML_CUDA_MMVQ_MOE_DENSE`) for the whole MoE expert selection, instead of a
per-quant gate (the per-quant style is exactly how the Q4_K/Q6_K arms leaked; the now-redundant Q8_0
macro gate is removed).  The `_MOE` macros keep their measured 4/4/2; only *reachability* is gated, so
RDNA4/RDNA3_0 keep the wide chunk.  Block 10 amended; blocks 11-15 replayed.

**Validation (gfx1151).**  Base-16 MoE `draft-mtp n3` **0.73967 -> 0.76484** (halves the gap to
upstream) and decode **87.5 -> 89.1 t/s**; dense 27B / qwen4exp unchanged; MoE `width_purity=PASS`;
`MUL_MAT_ID` **929/929**; `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5956/5956**.  **Beta re-port:** the 28 patches re-based
onto the fixed base (`git rebase --onto`, no conflicts; applied tree **`e00275ff…`**) and re-validated -
Gate 1 (dense/MoE/qwen4exp `none == draft-mtp n3` + `width_purity=PASS`), Gate 2 (dense +29/+25/+22 %,
MoE +26/+24/+19 %), Gate 3 (all oracles incl. `MUL_MAT_ID` 929/929), Gate 4 (dense 0.82188, MoE
0.75225, qwen4exp 0.82151, shared 0.82356).  Full record: `archive/work/mmb-general/BETA-TESTING.md` §9.

## 2026-09-25 — full gfx1151 beta-window re-validation + the `0027` `MUL_MAT_ID` fix + the MoE MTP gap root-caused

**Scope.** The `archive/work/mmb-general` 28-patch set re-based on `84e76d8a2` (tree `7f339b10`, delivery
`v16-84e76d8a2-r1`) was run through the **full four-gate gfx1151 beta-window re-validation**
(`archive/work/mmb-general/BETA-TESTING.md` §8) and the MoE-vs-upstream MTP acceptance gap was investigated.
No delivery/beta behaviour changed.

**`MUL_MAT_ID` abort (fixed in beta patch `0027`).**  The full oracle aborted on
`MUL_MAT_ID(type_a=f32,...)`: patch `0027`'s gfx1151 dense-band force in `ggml_cuda_mul_mat` enabled
MMVQ for any small batch with `src0->ne[1] % 128 != 0`, including non-quantized weights, so the F32
fallback slice reached `mul_mat_vec_q_switch_type` (no F32 case).  A one-line guard
(`ggml_is_quantized(src0->type)`) was folded into `0027` and the set regenerated (applied tree
`2e4e8004…` -> **`7f339b10…`**); the oracle is now **929/929** (upstream parity) and the quantized MoE
`tg128/tg512` is unchanged.  The guard is a **no-op** for the dense/MoE/qwen4exp models (a
non-quantized weight would have hit the default abort pre-fix and none did).

**Gates (gfx1151, tree `7f339b10`).**

* **Gate 1 purity — GREEN.**  `plain == draft-mtp n3` byte-identical on dense 27B Q8_0 (`90686d1edf24`),
  MoE 35B-A3B Q4_K_M (`d72a1fc679a5`) and qwen4exp IQ4_XS (`b746fb3e77ff`);
  `test-logits-width-probe … 1024 512` `width_purity=PASS (worst maxdiff 0)` on all three.
* **Gate 2 MMB win — GREEN.**  Interleaved MMB=1/0, `-r 3`: dense 27B pp2048/8192/32768 **+29 / +25 /
  +22 %**, MoE 35B-A3B **+26 / +23 / +19 %**.
* **Gate 3 oracles — GREEN.**  `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5956/5956**, `MUL_MAT_ID` **929/929**,
  `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` **26/26**, `GATED_DELTA_NET` **46/46**, `LIGHTNING_INDEXER` **225/225**,
  `INDEXER_TOPK` 0/0; `MMB_CFG cc=0x1001151 dense_geom=0 … routed=1`.
* **Gate 4 MTP Protocol A — GREEN.**  Reference command (`-c 262144 -ub 512`) reproduces §7 exactly:
  dense **0.82188** (20.3 vs 20.7 t/s), MoE **0.76164** (89.2 vs 54.0), qwen4exp **0.82151** (42.8 vs
  25.0), shared sidecar 0.82356 with 0 `X < Y`; a `-c 32768 -ub 2048` sweep also passes (dense 0.83240,
  MoE 0.75231, qwen4exp 0.84231, shared 0.84005).  All > 0.45 and MTP ≥ plain.
* **Recurrent.**  `test-recurrent-state-rollback` (qwen35-4B) **PASS** (`max diff 0`);
  `test-recurrent-state-depth` `total failures = 174` (Phase B, large `n_rs_batch`) — the old r13+beta
  build gives the **same 174**, i.e. pre-existing, not a re-base regression.

**MoE MTP acceptance gap vs upstream — root-caused, accepted trade, no code change.**  Same Protocol A
command, MoE 35B-A3B Q4_K_M: upstream `84e76d8a2` **0.78844** (92.3 t/s), base-16 delivery (tree
`336d0f43`) **0.73967** (87.5), beta default **0.76164** (89.2).  So the gap is **delivery-level and
MoE-specific** (dense models are at parity: upstream 0.82397 / base-16 0.81235 / beta 0.82188), the
beta `mmb` **improves** it (+0.022 acceptance, +1.7 t/s; `MMB=0` reproduces the base-16 value exactly),
and none of the three block-13 fused-MoE kill-switches (`SHEXP_DOWN_GATE`, `TOPK_MOE_FUSION`,
`MOE_MMQ_FUSION`) nor the beta mmvq band switches move it.  The residual is the delivery's **MoE expert
matmul/reduction-order policy** (block-10 k-quant + block-13 band-uniform `nwarps`/VDR, deliberately
compile-time — the width-purity invariant).  It is the documented numerics trade (`GREEDY-PURITY.md`
§19/§25): ~4 % acceptance / ~3 % MTP throughput for +48–62 % MoE prefill and ~+4 % decode, with
acceptance well above the bar and MTP ≥ plain everywhere.  Full tables and the arm matrix:
`archive/work/mmb-general/BETA-TESTING.md` §8.


## 2026-09-24 (r1) — `v16-84e76d8a2-r1`: the 16-block set re-based onto upstream master `84e76d8a2`

**Release** `v16-84e76d8a2-r1`, new fork point **`84e76d8a2`** (upstream master, 2026-09-24, tree
`5112eedbce0548ab9547d883e8aa54e993852e94`), canonical (rebased) block-15 tip
`ad858dee1057da63b8d81b883675de82ba60b2d9`, net tree `336d0f4318002409ed8ad5b04ae5bf344238c8ca`.
`scripts/validate-set.sh` green on a fresh `84e76d8a2` tarball: checksums, base tree, strict **16/16**
`git am`, applied tree == `336d0f43…`.  `rdna-boosts-all.patch` and `release.json` regenerated.

The previous baseline was `ebbb18522` (release `v16-ebbb18522-r13`, tree `bb7b6d07…`); this moves the
set forward **149 upstream commits**.  The re-base was done by replaying the real block commits (not
`git format-patch` + `git apply`) with `git rebase --onto 84e76d8a2 ebbb18522`, so the three-way merges
had the canonical blobs available; blocks 00-09 replayed without textual conflict (**some hunks
auto-merged**), blocks 10/14/15 needed manual resolution.  (A `git am` of the old patch set onto the
new base cannot 3-way-merge at all where upstream rewrote the same file — the canonical pre-image
blobs are absent from a fresh clone — which is why the re-base uses the fork commits and not the
patches.)

### Conflicts resolved (all preserving our work; upstream folded in where it is independent)

* **Block 10, `tests/test-backend-ops.cpp`** — the `MUL_MAT_ID` / `MUL_MAT_ID_FUSION` MoE test matrix.
  Our block 10 added `GGML_TYPE_Q5_K` and verify widths `5,6,7`; upstream `b1ff4ca23` (#28415) added
  `GGML_TYPE_IQ4_XS`.  Resolved as the **union**: `{F32,F16,Q4_0,Q8_0,Q4_K,Q5_K,Q6_K,IQ2_XS,IQ4_XS}`
  and `bs {1,4,5,6,7,8,32,64,128,256,512}`.
* **Block 14, `ggml/src/ggml-backend.cpp`** — upstream `911f6cdc8` (#26070) added the
  `ggml_gallocr_reserve_n()` failure check; our block 14 wraps that call in the
  `ggml_gallocr_reserve_n_probe()` growth test (`buffers_grown || n_async_devices > 1`).  Kept **our
  probe-gated structure** and adopted upstream's `"failed to reserve graph buffers"` diagnostic.
* **Block 14, `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/ggml-cuda.cu`** — upstream `1a679828f` (#28432) merged the MoE
  weighted-reduction and `topk_moe` visits into one `ggml_backend_cuda_graph_optimize` loop.  Took
  **upstream's loop** and applied our block-14 rename (`ggml_moe_weighted_reduction_match` /
  `ggml_match_moe_weighted_reduction`, now in `ggml-moe-weighted-reduction.h`).
* **Block 14, `src/models/qwen4exp.cpp`** — upstream `3cf03257f` (#28770) enabled the *generic* CUDA
  sparse FA for qwen4 by passing `top_k->ne[0]` as `build_attn_mha`'s `n_kv_max`.  Our block 14 keeps
  the **fused `GGML_OP_FLASH_ATTN_QSA` arm as the default**; the dense-mask fallback (`LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0`
  or a non-native KV type) is unchanged at `n_kv_max = 0`.  Upstream's enablement is therefore shadowed
  by the more advanced fused op on the default path.
* **Block 14, `tests/test-llama-archs.cpp`** — union of upstream `161755f29`'s `stdev` parameter and
  our block-14 `lazy_buf_size` parameter (and the corresponding call site carries both).
* **Block 15, `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn-mma-f16.cuh`** — the large one.  Upstream `1884824fd` (#28536)
  removed `fattn-swizzle.cuh` and collapsed the two swizzle booleans `swz_K`/`swz_V` into a single
  `swz` (`ggml_cuda_fattn_mma_get_swizzled`), and `3cf03257f`/`dc9879cf6` reworked the sparse `KV_max`
  path.  Kept our native-KV arguments (V4/V5) and the V3 derived mask, converted every call to the
  single `swz`, and pointed the block-15 native loaders at upstream's `swizzle_bytes<swz, half2>(i,
  k*h2_per_chunk, stride_tile)` (the `ggml_cuda_fattn_smem_swizzle::bytes_rc` helper is gone).
* **Block 15, `src/llama-context.cpp`** — upstream `965506136` (#26625) added
  `llama_graph_n_input_tensors()`; our block-15 amendment added `llama_context::kq_mask_packed_reachable()`.
  Both coexist (upstream's function feeds `sched_reserve`'s `n_input_tensors` report; ours feeds the
  worst-case packed-mask reserve).
* **Post-rebase compile fix (folded into block 15).**  block 15's two native loaders still referenced
  the removed `ggml_cuda_fattn_smem_swizzle::bytes_rc` helper, which only surfaced at build time; the
  block-15 commit was amended to use `swizzle_bytes`.  The surviving commits keep the `rdna-boosts:
  block NN:` subjects, so the patch filenames and the 16-block structure are unchanged.

### Validation (gfx1151 / Strix Halo, ROCm 7.14, `~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714`, ccache)

* Build green in ~6m30s (clean `rm -rf build-rocm`).
* Coherence: `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` (the AGENTS.md gate) and `Qwen3.5-9B-UD-Q8_K_XL` both emit sensible
  greedy continuations (41.5 / 18.6 t/s).
* `test-backend-ops`: `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5956/5956**, `GATED_DELTA_NET` **46/46**,
  `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` **22/22**.
* `test-speculative-adaptive`: all tests OK.  `test-recurrent-state-rollback` (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
  Q4_K_M): max diff 0, nmse 0 for both cache fills.
* `test-recurrent-state-depth`: **153 Phase-B failures** at large `n_rs_batch` — but the *pre-rebase*
  `mmb-beta` build produces the **identical 153 failures with identical max diffs**, so it is a
  pre-existing condition of the r13 line, **not** a re-base regression.  (The model used,
  `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`, has no MTP head in this test's configuration; the Phase-A verify-band sweep is
  green.)

### Beta set status

The `archive/work/mmb-general/` set (28 patches) is **not** re-based here and still targets the old r13 tree
(`bb7b6d07…` / `468c6496…`); do not `apply-beta.sh` on this baseline until it is re-cut.  That is the
next task, deliberately staged after the base patch set is frozen.

## 2026-09-22 (r13) — `v16-ebbb18522-r13`: block 00 gains the shared-NextN MTP fix

**Release** `v16-ebbb18522-r13`, canonical tip `8491bf2bff8eb3a56e5120c3c9c17533a94ea6bf`, net tree
`bb7b6d07b05ad8e23ab6e770172e7f597cfb3c12`.  Strict 16/16 `git am` on a fresh `ebbb18522` tarball
(`scripts/validate-set.sh` green: checksums, base tree, applied tree).

* **Problem.**  A `nextn_shared_target_tensors` MTP head (no `token_embd`/`output` of its own — e.g. the
  qwen4exp `mtp-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-shared-Q8_0.gguf` sidecar) borrows the target's tensors, so
  `llama_context` sets `cparams.ctx_other = ctx_tgt`.  `common/speculative.cpp` inferred **KV sharing**
  from that pointer and took the gemma4 same-position arm, so the second draft step re-added the
  position the target had already stored and M-RoPE rejected every round (`X < Y`), capping a draft at
  one token and leaving the adaptive controller inert.
* **Fix.**  Gate `is_mem_shared` on `general.architecture == "gemma4-assistant"` (the reference's
  approach).  The line is **upstream** (`04eb4c446 "llama : add Gemma4 MTP (#23398)"`, present at the
  fork point); block 01 only carries it as hunk context.
* **Home.**  **Block 00** (the structural/architecture base): a fundamental correctness fix that must
  precede every later block, and upstream is not ours to change.  It is also the
  `upstream/UPSTREAM-PR-mtp-shared-nextn` candidate for when upstream fixes it themselves.
* **Only block 00 changed in content.**  Blocks 01-15 rebased unchanged; their patches differ only in
  the `From <sha>` line and hunk context.  Block 00's commit message gained item 2.
* **Measured** (gfx1151, qwen4exp IQ4_NL + the shared Q8_0 head, `-n 256`): before, 78 `X < Y` errors
  and one-token drafts; after, **0 errors**, acceptance 0.287 (per-position 0.679/0.462/0.333…), the
  `draft-mtp-adaptive` path 35.4 t/s with real depth transitions.  The non-shared `Q4_K_M` head is
  unchanged (it never sets `ctx_other`).  Campaign record:
  `archive/work/closing-the-gap/2026-09-22-mtp-shared-nextn-fix.md`.
* **Regenerated.**  `scripts/make-patches.sh` + `make-release.sh`, `rdna-boosts-all.patch`; the rebuilt
  fork chain is `rdna-boosts-r13` (`8491bf2bff8eb3a56e5120c3c9c17533a94ea6bf`).  The WIP campaign's
  `patches/0015` is superseded by this (do not fold it again when rebuilding the campaign on r13).

## 2026-09-22 (WIP/dev, not a delivery change) — session-5 profile + `-lzm` semantics; managed PLE reader gated OFF

**No delivery change.**  Fork `gap-closing` tip **`9904c347d`** (9 gap-closing commits, exported as
`archive/work/closing-the-gap/patches/0009`).

* **Fresh target-ubatch profile** (qwen4exp IQ4_NL, gfx1151, `-b 8192 -ub 8192 -p 32768`): ours 52994 ms
  vs the reference 46737 ms (+13.4 %).  The remaining gap is **BF16 intermediate traffic** —
  `hc_combine_norm` +1811 ms (its `blk16`/`res16` vs our F32), MoE epilogue +633 ms
  (`MMB_DOWN16`) — plus the non-lossy `mmb_cvt` (+1478 ms), indexer relu-sum (+590 ms) and the dense
  GEMM call-count difference.  Full table + the memory accounting (28 GB PLE residency + 9 GB HC pins)
  in `archive/work/closing-the-gap/closing-the-gap.md` (session-5 finding).
* **`-lzm` semantics redefined** (was: `auto` = upstream auto only, `--lazy-buffer-size` selected a
  managed reader): now `on` = classic mmap lazy, `off` = full preload, `auto` = upstream auto with the
  **managed LRU PLE reader opt-in via `LLAMA_LAZY_BUF_MB=<MiB>`**; the `--lazy-buffer-size` CLI argument
  and `llama_model_params.n_lazy_buf_size` are removed.  The managed reader measured **slowest**
  (1090/1184 vs mmap 1219/1217 vs resident 1285/1232 t/s at pp8192/32768) so it is **OFF by default**
  (code kept for later perf work).  It does unlock the previously failing `-b/-ub 16384` context
  (1125.5 t/s at pp16384).  All lazy modes produce identical greedy text (`7e4a6a4e66fb`).
* Op oracles re-run green on the default gfx1151 build (`GATED_DELTA_NET`, `INDEXER_TOPK`,
  `FLASH_ATTN_QSA`, `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` 5955 OK / 0 FAIL); qwen4exp `plain == n3 == n7` (`61cebc1d31a9`),
  width probe PASS.

## 2026-09-22 (WIP/dev, not a delivery change) — retracted the cross-build `MMB=0 == r12` gate

**No delivery change.**  The "`MMB=0` must be byte-identical to r12" Gate 1 was the beta's opt-in-era
bisection check (while `GGML_CUDA_MMB` was `getenv ? atoi : 0`, "MMB unset" was literally r12 + the
arch-neutral groups).  It is **not** the purity contract: `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §5/§6 guarantee
*intra-build* agreement (the W=1..8 decode/verify band, `plain == draft-mtp`, the width probe), and
`archive/work/mmb-general/README.md` calls the MMB on/off logit change the **"approved prefill re-baseline"**.
Under the default-on policy `MMB=0` is also no longer "the default minus MMB".

Corrected references: `archive/work/closing-the-gap/closing-the-gap.md` (START HERE item 1, the session-3
"gates owed" line, + a new dated correction record), `archive/work/closing-the-gap/README.md` ("Do first" item
1) and `archive/work/mmb-general/BETA-TESTING.md` §0 + Gate 1.  Measured for the record (dense 27B Q8, 128-token
greedy, `prompts/prose-rdna-boosts.txt`, seed 42 / temp 0): r12 = `gap-closing MMB=0` = `2eb597253646`;
`gap-closing` default = `efad2aa9a83e` (the re-baseline).  Op oracles re-run green on the default
gfx1151 build: `GATED_DELTA_NET`, `INDEXER_TOPK`, `FLASH_ATTN_QSA`, `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` 5955 OK / 0 FAIL.

## 2026-09-21 (WIP, not a delivery change) — `archive/work/mmb-general` built on gfx1151; closing-the-gap plan + MTP qualification

**No delivery change.**  Session on the gfx1151 box (`halo`), after the gfx1201 agent's housekeeping
push (`830770a`, merged).

**Beta on gfx1151.**  The 12 `archive/work/mmb-general` patches were applied to `~/llama.cpp` (r12 +
patches, branch `mmb-beta`, tree `bca69f23dd…`) and built with `~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714`; clean
build, no errors.  This is the tree the `BETA-TESTING.md` re-validation runs against.

**New WIP: `archive/work/closing-the-gap/`.**  The 2026-09-20 `~/closing-the-gap.md` moved there and was
refreshed:  our reference is now the 12-patch `archive/work/mmb-general` (not the pre-promotion 5-patch gfx1151
WIP); pwilkin's branch moved `f5daaa3cf` → `b0f31f587` (10 commits — MMB quant coverage 10→23 types +
Flash-Next F32 PLE fusion; maskless-only-where-qsa3, also a prefill win; sparse QSA decode +
incremental indexer state, +11–20 % MTP decode; three cheap correctness fixes; and his tuned defaults
now compiled in with the `LLAMA_*` experiment switches deleted).  The beta set still does **not** close
gdn-conv/ple-conv, norm-gated, idx-relu-sum or hc-cn, and `hc_gate_mix_kernel` exists but is unwired.

**MTP qualification (`2026-09-21-mtp-qualification.md`).**  On qwen4exp IQ4_NL, gfx1151, `-n 3000`,
against his rebuilt `b0f31f587`:  our **plain** decode is ahead (+2–6 %); at fixed depth the MTP
**speedup is at parity** (ours `n3` 1.90/1.78/2.05x vs his 1.91/1.79/2.02x on code/prose/recall), so
his MTP is not a speed gap; our `draft-mtp-adaptive` wins recall (2.40x) but over-drafts code/prose at
`n_max 12` (a tuning item — `adaptive 7` beats `n3` on code).  **The one real MTP gap is
correctness/compat: `nextn_shared_target_tensors`.**  The shared MTP sidecar pwilkin's own IQ4_NL model
ships fails every draft position past the first on our build (M-RoPE `X < Y` consistency check), while
the non-shared `Q4_K_M` sidecar runs clean on both trees.

**Priority sequence set (maintainer):** recall speed + correctness → decode speed + correctness → MTP
tuning + correctness.  §13 of the closing-the-gap doc is regrouped into those three phases (MTP parked).

## 2026-09-21 (WIP, not a delivery change) — beta set waiting on gfx1151; next campaign starts there

**No delivery change.**  State of play after the promotion, recorded so the next session does not have
to reconstruct it:

**The `archive/work/mmb-general` set is waiting on the gfx1151 box** for its final re-validation
(`archive/work/mmb-general/BETA-TESTING.md`).  The campaign was developed and tuned on gfx1151, then ported to
gfx1201 and gfx1100; that combination has never been re-run on gfx1151.  The branch to take over is
**`archive/work/mmb-general`** (pushed; also `main` @ `3f2eaf8`), 12 patches, applied tree
`bca69f23dd29acef2d8898c6fd492104e078eef1`.

**The next campaign starts on the gfx1151 machine**, and will then be ported to this box.  The
maintainer's read is that it is **largely architecture independent** — i.e. generic kernel/graph work
of the same class as G5 (the indexer top-k) and G4 (the non-temporal hints), which needed no
fragment-layout work and were pure apply-and-gate ports.  The target is a **+10-20 % qwen4exp
speedup** (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next), which makes the gfx1201 qwen4exp baseline the one that matters for the
port:

| gfx1201 qwen4exp reference (3-GPU tensor, q8_0 KV, `-b/-ub 2048`) | t/s |
|---|---:|
| delivery (r12) pp32768 / pp65536 / pp98304 | 2372 / 2213 / 2073 |
| **beta set (12 patches) pp32768 / pp65536 / pp98304** | **2897 / 2713 / 2557** |
| the same, decomposed: mmb alone | +6.0-6.5 % |
| the same, decomposed: arch-neutral groups (G5/G4/G3a) + qsa3 | +14.4-16.3 % |

So a +10-20 % qwen4exp claim on gfx1151 should land as roughly **+10-20 % on top of 2897/2713/2557**
here, and the acceptance/width/PPL gates are the ones that protect it (`archive/work/mmb-general/BETA-TESTING.md`
§2, and `gfx1201-s14-gates.md` for the full B1-B9 runbook).

**Instrumentation preserved rather than re-derived.**  The campaign's A/B harness had been rebuilt from
scratch several times and lives in `/tmp` each time; it is now in **`archive/work/mmb-general/tools/`**:
`ab-interleaved.sh` (interleaved delivery-vs-WIP benchmark with a per-test mean and the delivery's own
spread) and `lbparse.py` (llama-bench **and** `test-backend-ops` output).  The parser deliberately
encodes the two traps that cost time this campaign — llama-bench's `tg128 @ d16384` test naming, and
the rule that `test-backend-ops` must never be counted from a `2>&1`-merged log (ANSI-wrapped status +
stdout/stderr interleaving orphans it; the `--ops` mode pairs a status with its preceding name and so
returns a stable `5953/5954 OK, 0 FAIL` from a merged *or* separated capture).  Both were tested
against the real logs before being committed; the tools README states the depth/verdict rule
(prefer pp32768+, the shallow end is clock-ramped, never run two benches at once).

## 2026-09-21 (WIP, not a delivery change) — `wip/mmb-general` promoted to `archive/work/mmb-general`

**No delivery change.**  The `mmb-general` campaign left `wip/` and entered its beta window: the
directory moved to **`archive/work/mmb-general/`** on `main`, and the one patch that could not ship was
extracted to a new **`wip/nwarps/`** tree.

**The beta set is 12 patches**, `git am` **12/12** from the r12 fork point, applied tree
**`bca69f23dd29acef2d8898c6fd492104e078eef1`**:

* `0001`-`0010` — the gfx1151-developed, gfx1201-portable core (the `mmb` bf16-WMMA dequant weight
  GEMM, `qsa3`, the F32/tiny-M kernels, HC16, the indexer top-k, and the RDNA4 fragment port with its
  per-arch policy table).  These were the 10 canonical patches.
* `0011`-`0012` — the gfx1100 (RDNA3_0) deltas, **folded in** at promotion: enable `qsa3` on RDNA3_0
  (0021's predicate widening) and default the F32 split tile off there.  The overlay directory
  `archive/work/mmb-general/gfx1100/` is kept for provenance and now says so.

**`wip/nwarps/` is the extraction.**  The gfx1100 per-M `nwarps` patch was the third overlay patch; it
was **removed from the set** and is now `wip/nwarps/patches/per-M-nwarps-rdna3-0.patch` with a
self-contained README.  Two reasons:

1. It **breaks the `W = 1..8` width-purity contract** on MoE models — the 35B fails at threshold 2048
   (maxdiff 0.150), gemma-26B at 4096 (**maxdiff 3.35, a correctness red flag, not rounding**), and
   the 27B at 6144+.  The largest *pure* threshold (1024) gives no measurable gain, while the impure
   ones give +2.1 % (35B draft-mtp / gemma-26B decode) and a blanket `nwarps=1` gives +9 %.  Root
   cause: the width-invariant reduction mapping was derived for the delivery's per-type `nwarps`, so
   changing `nwarps` for those shapes invalidates it.  **That is the open impurity to investigate** —
   essentially redoing the issue-#30 band-uniformity derivation for `nwarps=1`.
2. It **doubled the `mul_mat_vec_q_ksplit` instantiation set on every architecture** — `mmvq.cu.o`
   8.5 -> 12 MiB (+41 %), 828 -> 1656 ksplit symbols (+100 %), all `mul_mat_vec_q*` 1851 -> 2679 —
   because `small_m` is a *template* axis while the host branches on it at *runtime*, so both variants
   compile even on the two arches where the feature can never fire.

**The gfx1151 re-validation is the next step.**  The campaign was developed and tuned on gfx1151, then
ported to gfx1201 and gfx1100; the **combination has never been re-run on gfx1151** — the individual
"gfx1151 unchanged" claims were made one step at a time (mostly by comparing device assembly), never
once end-to-end on the final set.  `archive/work/mmb-general/BETA-TESTING.md` is the checklist: (1) MMB **off**
must be byte-identical to r12 (**retracted 2026-09-22** — that was the opt-in-era bisection aid, not the
purity contract; `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §5/§6 make the guarantee *intra-build*), with `test-logits-width-probe` PASS; (2) `GGML_CUDA_MMB=1` must still
recover the original **+32…+48 %** gfx1151 prefill win (the risk the per-arch table introduced);
(3) the four op oracles, with the `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` counting trap called out; (4) MTP at `-n 3000` with
acceptance > 0.45 and MTP ≥ plain.

**Also recorded** (from the merge work this session): the gfx1100 branch merged clean, the combined set
was verified on gfx1201 as unchanged (byte-identical `MMB_CFG`, all three same-seed hashes, oracles,
width purity, pp8192/32768 934.86/856.71 vs the frozen 932.8/856.7), and the `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` "random
matrix" claim from the S14 record was corrected — it is **5954 OK / 0 FAIL and fully deterministic**,
and the apparent movement was a `2>&1` stream-interleaving parse trap.

**Docs:** `AGENTS.md` (the `wip/`+`beta/` layout rows and the WIP-branch bullet, since `beta/` is no
longer empty), `archive/work/mmb-general/README.md` (beta header + what is in the set), the new
`BETA-TESTING.md`, `wip/nwarps/README.md`, `combined-set-verification.md` (postscript), `GROUPS.md`
(apply order = 12 patches; the 0013 decision resolved), and the `gfx1100/README.md` fold note.

## 2026-09-21 (WIP, not a delivery change) — gfx1100 merged: the combined 3-arch set

**Experimental WIP.**  `origin/wip-mmb-general-gfx1100` (12 commits, branched from `c79d48f`) was
merged into `wip-mmb-general` at `10fc552`, so one branch now carries **gfx1151 + gfx1201 + gfx1100**.
Record: `wip/mmb-general/combined-set-verification.md`.

**The merge was clean** — one auto-resolved `GROUPS.md` hunk (gfx1100 added a pointer at the top of
the "gfx1100 job" section while the gfx1201 side rewrote the steps beneath it; git kept both).  gfx1100
brought `gfx1100-porting.md` (889 lines), `gfx1100/README.md`, 8 dated result files, and an overlay of
**3 patches numbered 0011-0013** — correctly continuing our `0001-0010`, so **no collision**.

**The combined set is 13 patches and applies 13/13 from r12**, producing tree
**`cd306e6b6093b63468289edac24fbea3d270dbe2`** — verified both on top of the existing 10-patch state
and **fresh** from a detached worktree at `c3ee45747` (the gfx1201-frozen tree was `35fc853e63…`).

**Why the overlay is safe for the other two arches (reviewed before accepting it):** 0011 adds
`GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3_0` to the qsa3 support predicate — purely additive, RDNA4/RDNA3_5 were already
accepted; 0012 adds one `if (GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3_0(cc))` arm to `mmb_arch_defaults(cc)` — RDNA4
keeps S13's `f32split_mode = 1`, RDNA3_5 keeps the struct default; 0013's `small_m` is gated
`table_id == MMVQ_PARAMETERS_RDNA3_0 && !has_fusion && nrows_x <= mmvq_rdna3_0_small_m()` with that
accessor defaulting to **0**, so it is provably false on every arch unless explicitly enabled.

**Verified on gfx1201, not assumed.**  Built the combined tree and re-ran the gates; every value is
identical to the frozen 10-patch result: the `MMB_CFG` dump is **byte-identical** (the strongest check
— it proves 0012's arm did not leak into the RDNA4 row), the three same-seed hashes are unchanged
(`42cdf36d0633`, `461ca8cd0e88`, `d73f9238f6d6`), `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 26 cases + `GATED_DELTA_NET` +
`INDEXER_TOPK` are green, `test-logits-width-probe` still `PASS (worst maxdiff 0)`, and 27B UD-IQ3_S
pp8192/32768 measures **934.86 / 856.71** against the frozen 932.8 / 856.7.

**One cost, flagged for a decision.**  Patch 0013 is default-OFF and its own documentation says it is
unshippable (it breaks the W=1..8 width-purity contract on MoE models; the only pure threshold gives no
gain) — yet because it threads `small_m` as a *template* axis and the host branches on it at **runtime**,
both variants are compiled on **every** arch, including the two where it can never fire:

| `mmvq.cu.o` | 10-patch | combined | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| object size | 8.5 MiB | 12 MiB | **+41 %** |
| `mul_mat_vec_q_ksplit` symbols | 828 | 1656 | **+100 %** |
| all `mul_mat_vec_q*` symbols | 1851 | 2679 | +45 % |

So the scaffold buys dead instantiations on gfx1201/gfx1151.  Whether it belongs in the default apply
set or should be applied only for the nwarps experiment is a maintainer call — the work is preserved
either way, because it is a separate patch.

**Docs updated:** `GROUPS.md` (apply order now 13 patches + the completed gfx1100 section and the 0013
decision point), `README.md` (session 35), and the new `combined-set-verification.md`.

## 2026-09-21 (WIP, not a delivery change) — gfx1201 port, session 34b: S15, the freeze and hand-off

`S15` of `wip/mmb-general/gfx1201-porting.md`.  **Experimental WIP.**  S14 found nothing to fix, so no
code changed and there is no patch 11 — the set was already final.  Frozen and verified:

* `git format-patch --start-number 1 c3ee45747..mmb-port-qsa3` reproduces `patches/*` **byte-for-byte**
  (no drift), and `git diff c3ee45747..mmb-port-qsa3` reproduces `mmb-general.patch` exactly.
* `commits.txt` matches `git log --format='%H %s' c3ee45747..HEAD`.
* **`git am` 10/10** on a fresh worktree at r12 `c3ee45747`, applied tree
  **`35fc853e6396cb0867e7e27c1e8e21093699db47`** == the fork tree == the tree S14 validated.

**The gfx1201 port is complete.**  Frozen set: **10 patches**, base r12 `c3ee45747`, tree
`35fc853e6396cb0867e7e27c1e8e21093699db47`.  Whole-WIP prefill win vs the delivery on qwen4exp
Flash-Next (3-GPU tensor, q8_0 KV): **+21.9/+22.5/+22.7 %** at pp32768/65536/98304, with B1-B9 all
green including MTP (0.636 dense / 0.724 MoE / 0.701 qwen4exp acceptance).

Docs updated: `gfx1201-porting.md` (§11 hand-off, §13.0 status, §13.1 definition-of-done all ticked,
the S15 record, and the §6e corrections), `GROUPS.md` (the gfx1201 results incl. the whole-WIP vs
mmb-only distinction, the frozen tree, and a gfx1100 job that now carries the three traps gfx1201 found
the hard way), `README.md` (session 34 + 34b, with a supersede note on session 33's mmb-only numbers),
and this log.

**Handed to gfx1100:** the tree above, the patch set in `wip/mmb-general/patches/`, and `GROUPS.md`'s
**gfx1100 job** section.  `~/llama.cpp`'s `mmb-port-qsa3` branch stays local — the patch set is the
deliverable and nothing is pushed out of the fork checkout (AGENTS.md Pushing policy).  Per-arch
constants now live in one table (`mmb_arch_cfg` / `mmb_arch_defaults(cc)`, S11), so gfx1100's job is a
row edit plus a `GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3_0` arm, with `GGML_CUDA_MMB_CFG=1` to prove which constants a
run used.

## 2026-09-21 (WIP, not a delivery change) — gfx1201 port, session 34: S14, the B1-B9 gate matrix

`s14` of `wip/mmb-general/gfx1201-porting.md`.  **Experimental WIP**; record in
`wip/mmb-general/gfx1201-s14-gates.md`.  **No code changed** — this was the campaign's biggest
coverage gap: B1-B7 had only ever been recorded as a delivery-vs-WIP pair at S1, B8 was partial, and
**B9 (MTP) had never been run on gfx1201 at all**.  Tree under test `35fc853e6396cb0867e7e27c1e8e21093699db47`
(10 patches, `git am` 10/10).  **All gates green.**

| gate | result |
|---|---|
| S14.3a config record | `MMB_CFG cc=0x1001201 dense_geom=1 ... routed=0` matched the expected string exactly |
| B1/B2 coherence | **5/5 reference hashes identical** across delivery / WIP-MMB-off / WIP-MMB-on |
| B3 dense 27B UD-IQ3_S | +0.44/+0.64 % pp8192, +0.61/+0.59 % pp32768 (reproduces S10) |
| B4 decode | tg128 and tg128@d16384 **flat** (MMB is prefill-only) |
| B5 MoE 35B UD-Q3_K_M | +0.43..+0.63 % (S12 had it neutral) |
| B5 qwen4exp Flash-Next | **+21.9/+22.5/+22.7 %** at pp32768/65536/98304 |
| B6 oracles | `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 26 cases (incl. 3 `qsa3=1`), `GATED_DELTA_NET`, `INDEXER_TOPK`, `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **0 FAIL** |
| B7 width purity | `PASS (worst maxdiff 0)` with MMB **on and off** |
| B8 PPL | WIP-MMB-off **bit-identical** to the delivery (9.4293); MMB-on +0.022 % |
| B9 MTP | **green on all three families** — dense 0.636, MoE 0.724, qwen4exp 0.644/0.701 acceptance; MTP +56..77 % over plain; purity byte-identical |
| B9 rule 5 | verify-width (`-npl 1,4,8`) within noise of the delivery at every width |

**MTP on gfx1201 for the first time.**  Dense 27B UD-IQ3_S: `draft-mtp` 50.0 t/s vs plain 28.2
(+77 %), acceptance 0.63624 with pos-1 0.797, and `plain == draft-mtp` byte-identical.  MoE 35B
UD-Q4_K_M: 146.1 vs 88.1 (+66 %), acceptance 0.72372, pos-1 0.856, purity byte-identical, and
**ahead of the recorded 2026-09-02 MoE baseline** (125.8 t/s / 0.51) — with the delivery showing the
same numbers, so that is the delivery's own tuning, not a WIP effect.  qwen4exp (needs the separate
`-md` head): 80.7 vs 49.3 (+64 %), acceptance 0.70093.  **The dense and MoE MTP results are
byte-identical to the delivery including acceptance** -- the port's decode-adjacent changes do not
touch the MTP path at all.

**The whole-WIP qwen4exp win at depth is +22 %, not +6 %.**  Interleaving the *same* WIP binary with
`GGML_CUDA_MMB` toggled decomposes it: mmb alone is +6.5/+6.2/+6.0 % (which is exactly what S13
recorded) and the arch-neutral groups + qsa3 are +14.4/+15.3/+16.3 %.  Both figures are real; they
measure different things.

**Two corrections to the S14 brief, both the same mistake in kind:** the delivery Flash-Next
reference row (`2728/2591/2465`) was wrong -- those are *qsa3-on, mmb-off* WIP numbers (S4 recorded
qsa3 pp32768 = 2724), and the real delivery is **2372/2213/2073**, reproducing the S1/S2 record
(2379/2216/2074) to 0.3 %.  And the brief's "expected landed +6.7/+6.5/+6.2 %" is the **mmb-only**
delta.  **"ON vs OFF" in S10-S13 always meant MMB-on vs MMB-off within the WIP binary, never WIP vs
delivery** -- that distinction needs to be explicit in every report.

Two findings worth carrying forward:

* **A draft head cannot be loaded standalone.**  `-md <mtp-head>` with `--spec-type none` aborts: a
  clean deliberate error on 1 GPU ("this model is an MTP draft head without a trunk; load it as a
  draft of its target model, not on its own"), but on a `-sm tensor` split an
  `GGML_ASSERT(!suffix_fallback.empty())` at `llama-model.cpp:470` in the meta-split graph builder,
  and `-fit off` does not avoid it.  **Pre-existing and identical on the delivery r12** (maintainer
  confirms upstream too) -- not a WIP regression.  Harness rule: the `plain` arm must not pass `-md`.
* **Flash-Next IQ4_XS has no built-in `nextn` head** (the 27B and both 35B-A3B models do), so
  qwen4exp must be given `-md` while the others must not.  Check for `'nextn' in t.name` first.

**Correction to this entry's own first analysis (same day).**  It initially concluded that
`FLASH_ATTN_EXT`'s case count was "randomised run-to-run", because counting `(...): OK` lines from the
usual `2>&1`-merged log gave 1947/1949/1951 with ~34 cases moving between runs.  **That was wrong.**
`-j` defaults to 1 and the run loop visits every case once, in order, in one thread; the case list is
deterministic (every run printed exactly 8090 name lines).  The real mechanism is a **log-parsing
trap**: the status is ANSI-wrapped (`printf("\033[1;32mOK\033[0m\n")`), and `print_test_console`
writes the name to stdout while the test emits CUDA-graph-warmup/allocation notices to stderr -- so
merging `2>&1` into a file (stdout block-buffered, stderr not) orphans the status onto its own line.
Paired-parsing all five captures gives **5953/5954 OK and 0 FAIL in every run**, on the delivery and
the WIP alike -- and **the brief's `5951/5951` was right** all along (the small delta is a build
difference).  Two captures of the same run: merged = 1951 attached + 4003 orphaned = 5954; stdout-only
= 5953 attached + 1 orphaned = 5954.  Identical total.  **Never count `test-backend-ops` results from a
merged `2>&1` log -- separate the streams, and strip ANSI.**

**S15 remains**: freeze, regenerate the patch set, verify `git am` N/N on a fresh r12 worktree, update
the docs and hand gfx1100 the tree.

## 2026-09-21 (WIP, not a delivery change) — gfx1201 port, session 33: the F32 split was never running

`s13` of `wip/mmb-general/gfx1201-porting.md`.  **Experimental WIP**; record in
`wip/mmb-general/gfx1201-s13-f32-hc16.md`.

The two F32 paths shared one predicate, so `GGML_CUDA_MMB_F32SPLIT=0` also killed the tiny-M
warp-per-token kernel; and the split *tile* was additionally gated behind `mmb_dense_flag()`, which is
off on RDNA4 -- so **neither had ever run on gfx1201**.  Separated, both win, and the split tile scales
with depth (Flash-Next IQ4_XS, 3-GPU tensor, interleaved r=3, vs the delivery):

| depth | split OFF | split ON | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| pp8192 | 2853.85 | 2844.97 | -0.3 % |
| pp32768 | 2862.96 | 2889.61 | +0.9 % |
| pp65536 | 2725.18 | 2752.31 | **+1.00 %** |
| pp98304 | 2585.55 | 2616.95 | **+1.22 %** |

So it costs a fraction of a percent at the start of a run and pays >1 % at depth -- a shallow A/B had
read it as noise.  Landed: qwen4exp **+6.7 / +6.5 %** shallow and **+6.2 %** at 64k/98k (S12 was
+4.9/+5.2); 27B IQ3_S +0.5 %; IQ-heavy MoE neutral; same-seed text byte-identical on all three models.
Mechanism: rocBLAS `MT64x64x16` 1.923 -> 0.242 s, taken by `mmb_f32split_kernel` (0.306 s) +
`mmb_tiny_m_f32_kernel` (0.429 s).

**HC16 / BLK16 / RES16 / DOWN16 are inert** on gfx1201: 0.03 % spread on 27B UD-IQ3_S *where the
conversion stream is live* (178 `MMB_CVT` lines) and noise on qwen4exp -- stay default 0.  `TINY_TT`
2/4 and `CACHE=32` are noise too.  Landed as **patch 10** (`git am` 10/10, applied tree
`35fc853e6396cb0867e7e27c1e8e21093699db47`); gfx1151 device kernels byte-unchanged.

The qwen4exp win has now gone +3.1/+3.4 (S7) -> +4.9/+5.2 (S12) -> **+6.7/+6.5 (S13)**, each step by
removing a gate S7 had put in front of a path that wins on RDNA4.  Pattern recorded in GROUPS.md:
*when a path is disabled by a policy flag, measure it with the flag overridden before concluding it
loses*; and *a shallow A/B is not a verdict for a long-context workload*.

## 2026-09-21 (WIP, not a delivery change) — gfx1201 port, session 32: the routed MoE path is a loss on RDNA4

`s12` of `wip/mmb-general/gfx1201-porting.md`.  **Experimental WIP, not part of the delivered patch
set**; record in `wip/mmb-general/gfx1201-s12-routed-policy.md`.

Session 30 disproved S7's routed claim (the unmodified S7 binary measures -1.4 % where S7 recorded
+6.7 %).  S12 acted on it: a per-arch `routed` field in `mmb_arch_cfg` + `mmb_routed_flag()`
(`GGML_CUDA_MMB_ROUTED=0|1`), gating `supported_mmid`/`supported_glu`/`routed_will_take`, with
**`routed = 0` as the RDNA4 default**.  The routed path loses on every model measured (interleaved,
two rounds, pp8192 / pp32768):

| model | routed ON | routed OFF |
|---|---|---|
| 35B-A3B UD-Q3_K_M (qwen35moe) | -1.44 / -1.39 % | **-0.05 / -0.09 %** |
| Flash-Next IQ4_XS (qwen4exp, 3-GPU tensor) | +2.3 / +1.8 % | **+6.6 / +5.4 %** |

Cause (session 30's 1-GPU kernel breakdown): the delivery's block-13 `mul_mat_q_routed_compact` +
`mul_mat_q` cost 0.880 s vs mmb's routed kernels at 0.875 s -- a tie -- and the stand-down adds
0.065 s of `mm_ids_helper`.  Landed default vs the delivery: qwen4exp **+4.9 / +5.2 %** (was +2.3 /
+1.8), IQ-heavy MoE **neutral** (was -1.4), IQ3_S dense +0.5 %, Q8_0/Q4_K_M neutral, same-seed text
**byte-identical to the delivery everywhere**.  Landed as **patch 9** (`git am` 9/9, applied tree
`4a78af6349df3fd92e747d223ea3b4b32817f592`); gfx1151 untouched (arch default keeps `routed = 1`,
kernel set byte-unchanged).

The second correction this work has produced to the S7 record (the first being session 30's -- the
S7 routed +6.7 % does not reproduce).  With the routed path off, the routed/GLU threshold sweep is
moot on RDNA4.

## 2026-09-21 (WIP, not a delivery change) — gfx1201 port, session 31: per-arch `mmb` tuning defaults

`s11` of `wip/mmb-general/gfx1201-porting.md`.  **Experimental WIP, not part of the delivered patch
set**; record in `wip/mmb-general/gfx1201-s11-arch-defaults.md`.

Every `mmb_*` tunable was env-only with a hard-coded gfx1151 value, so no arch could differ without a
wall of env vars -- and because the gates are lazy host `getenv`s, a `rocprofv3` trace could not say
which policy produced it (the plan's §12.5 problem).  There is now one table, `struct mmb_arch_cfg`,
selected once from `ggml_cuda_info().devices[0].cc` by `mmb_arch_defaults(cc)`, with the existing env
var kept as the override on every accessor; the S10 dense geometry moved out of the dispatch into
`c.dense_geom`.  New **`GGML_CUDA_MMB_CFG=1`** prints the resolved config once.

RDNA4's row carries only the *measured* value (the geometry); every other field keeps the gfx1151
value and is marked `TODO(S12)` -- no invented tuning.  Verified: same-seed hash unchanged; the
**gfx1151 device asm kernel set is byte-unchanged** (90 kernels, 0 differing); the 27B UD-IQ3_S
interleaved r=5 win is preserved (**+0.45 % pp8192 / +0.46 % pp32768**).  Landed as **patch 8**
(`git am` 8/8, applied tree `e5dc99b4d59dc5244de879825d1e8aa025b76263`); patches 6-8 are a chain on
`mmb.cu`.

## 2026-09-21 (WIP, not a delivery change) — gfx1201 port, session 30: the RDNA4 dense tile geometry

`s10` of `wip/mmb-general/gfx1201-porting.md`.  **This is experimental WIP, not part of the delivered
patch set**; the record lives in `wip/mmb-general/gfx1201-s10-dense-geometry.md`.

**The RDNA4 `mmb` dense tile lost for every weight type because of the geometry, not the
architecture.**  `rocprofv3 --kernel-trace` carries `VGPR_Count`/`LDS_Block_Size` per launch, which
settled it: the gfx1151-tuned tile needs **55296 B of LDS** -> **1 workgroup per CU** (8 warps, 2 per
SIMD) against the delivery MMQ's **0 LDS / 3 blocks**; and at `BM=128` only **half** the 256 threads
dequantise the A (weight) panel.  A **256x128** tile (WTM=64, WTN=64, TMxTN=4x4) makes the IQ3_S
dense GEMM beat the delivery MMQ **for the first time**: 1.856 s vs 1.944 s = **-4.5 %** (27B UD-IQ3_S,
pp4096, 1 GPU).  IQ4_XS still loses (+10.9 %), IQ3_XXS/IQ4_NL are break-even, so the dense path is a
**per-weight-TYPE** decision: RDNA4 enables it for IQ3_S only.

* 27B UD-IQ3_S interleaved A/B (r=5, two rounds agreeing to 0.02 %): **+0.52 % pp8192 / +0.46 %
  pp32768**.  27B Q8_0 exactly neutral.  Flash-Next IQ4_XS (qwen4exp, 3-GPU tensor) **+3.2 / +2.2 %**
  (the S7 qwen4exp win reproduces).
* Same-seed greedy text identical to the delivery **and to every valid geometry** (geometry is
  numerics-neutral).  Validity rule: `BN` must equal `(8/(BM/WTM))*WTN`, else the kernel silently
  computes only part of the output and *looks* fast (a 256x192/WTN48 arm measured a fake -39 %).
* **gfx1151 instruction-identical**: 79/79 existing kernels, md5 `fc698705809822f4c821adb115367dc8`
  (the 11 new 256x128 kernels are unreachable there).
* **Correction to the S7 record:** the `35B-A3B UD-Q3_K_M` "+6.7 % MoE" does **not** reproduce -- the
  *unmodified S7 binary* now measures **-1.4 %**, because the routed MMB only **matches** the
  delivery's `mul_mat_q_routed_compact` + `mul_mat_q<IQ3_XXS,64>` and the stand-down costs an extra
  `mm_ids_helper` launch.  The routed MoE default needs a re-decision.

## 2026-09-21 (r12) — `v16-ebbb18522-r12`: `--fit` supports `-sm tensor` (beta/tensor-fit-fix promoted, block 06)

**Release** `v16-ebbb18522-r12`, canonical tip `54f8a57fc50344f738c363c13b243a0ad81f70da`, net tree
`8a80535e556bef57666d2eaa4d3eb4cf93fb83f5`.  Only **block 06** changed in content; blocks 07-15 sit above
it and carry new `From <sha>`/`index` lines with unchanged bodies, and blocks 00-05 are byte-identical to
r11.  The net `rdna-boosts-all.patch` is byte-identical to the block-15-placement cut, i.e. only the block
*distribution* moved.

**Promoted from `beta/tensor-fit-fix/`** (now `archive/work/tensor-fit-fix/`) on the maintainer's
go-ahead, after the re-validation below.  The change is generic llama.cpp - `common/fit.cpp`,
`ggml/include/ggml-backend.h` (two accessors de-static'd), `ggml/src/ggml-backend-meta.cpp` and
`docs/multi-gpu.md` (the `tensor` caveat removed) - and it is still worth an `upstream/`
`UPSTREAM-PR-*` candidate.

**The gap.**  `--fit` is on by default, but under `-sm tensor` `common_params_fit_impl()` threw
"llama_params_fit is not implemented for SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR" and `common_fit_params()` swallowed the
exception, so the fit never ran and the user's `-c`/`-ngl`/`-ts` were left exactly as passed.  That is
upstream behaviour, documented in `docs/multi-gpu.md`, from the original fit-params PR #22171.

**Why it is not a one-liner.**  Under `-sm tensor` with more than one device every GPU is wrapped in a
single Meta device, so the existing fit algorithm (layer-granular `tensor_split[id] = n_layer`,
whole-tensor CPU overflow) cannot express "shard every layer", and the Meta row of
`llama_get_memory_breakdown()` counts `model` once while `context`/`compute` are the largest *per-device*
sub-buffer.  The fix expands the Meta device back into its simple devices and works per device:
`target_i = free_i - margin_i`, `tensor_split[i] ∝ target_i` (or honour a user `-ts` as a constraint and
log the `effective budget`), then reduce an auto `n_ctx` and binary-search `n_gpu_layers` down.  An
explicit `-c` is never overridden.

**Placement: block 06, the general system-operations bucket.**  `common/fit.cpp`,
`ggml/include/ggml-backend.h` and `docs/multi-gpu.md` are touched by **no** delivery block, and the Meta
accessors already exist upstream (file-static), so the change depends on no block and nothing later can
invalidate it.  Block 06 already held that role (the host-buffer revert lost its purpose when upstream
reverted #24233 in #28604, and the block took on the generic work, starting with the r6 FA instance
build-time fix), which is where a standalone `--fit` fix belongs.  Its only overlap is
`ggml-backend-meta.cpp`, which blocks 09/14/15 also touch but at lines ~790-2600 versus this change's
~83/~196; replaying blocks 07-15 on the amended block 06 applies cleanly and yields a tree byte-identical
to the earlier block-15 placement, which is the invariant that proves only the distribution moved.
The alternative home is `upstream/` as an `UPSTREAM-PR-*` candidate, which remains worth doing.

**Re-validated on r11 before promotion** (the patch was written against the r5/r6-era tree, and r11
changed what the fit has to reserve, since the reachable packed kq mask now sits in the reserve for
M-RoPE models):

* **Fit decisions.**  The comfortable cases reproduce the 2026-09-18 record exactly: 27B Q8_0 2 GPU
  `-c 4096` -> `-c 4096 -ngl -1 -ts 31254,31254`; 3 GPU -> `-ts 31254,31254,31254`; auto-ctx
  `--fit-target 16000,16000` -> estimate 59899 vs 32556 target and `n_ctx` 262144 -> **43264**, against
  the beta's 59901 -> 43264.  The `-ngl`-reduction cases land **lower** than the beta (3 GPU
  `--fit-target 30000 x3`: 12 -> **4**; pinned `-ts 1,3 --fit-target 26000 x2`: 17 -> **7**; MoE 35B-A3B
  `--fit-target 26000 x2`: 14 -> **11**) because the fit must now size for that mask; its internal trace
  is monotonic and stays under budget in every case, so the change is in the conservative direction.
* **End-to-end (7 configs, all `--fit on -sm tensor`).**  27B Q8_0 comfortable / auto-ctx / embedded MTP
  (2 GPU) / 3 GPU, 27B + **separate** MTP head with `--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive` (the issue #38
  path), MoE 35B-A3B, and a pinned `-c 262144 --fit-target 16000,16000` (`-ngl` reduction).  Every one
  loads, generates, and logs **zero** `out of memory`, **zero** `failed to allocate graph` and **zero**
  compute-buffer growth.  MTP acceptance 1.0 (embedded) and 0.5 (adaptive + separate head).  The
  load-time breakdown shows `compute` tracking context (126 MiB at `-c 4096` -> 378 MiB at
  `n_ctx 48640`), i.e. the r11 mask is inside what the fit now counts.
* **Coherence gate.**  With the fit deactivated (`--fit off`, explicit `-c 8192 -ngl 99 -ts 1,1`) and a
  fixed seed, r11 and r11 + this patch are **byte-identical**
  (`19ee51a93e6c9806b614b333cc0ef9ba64d60fbc9502565726bfdf51bd20b924`), as expected for a change confined
  to `common/fit.cpp` plus two `static` removals.
* **Balance + single device.**  Asymmetric `--fit-target 1024,8000` (the fit chooses `-ts 31254,24278`):
  peak per device by `rocm-smi` **15900 / 11994 MiB** against the 2026-09-18 record's 15925 / 12018
  (within 0.2 %), ~3 % above the ideal proportional split (loader per-tensor rounding plus replicated
  tensors), 0 OOM and 0 growth.  The loader's `Meta() model buffer size = 14893.51 MiB` agrees (the
  larger device's share of a 25972 MiB model at ratio 0.5628).  The **single-device** case that block 07
  creates (no Meta wrapper) also engages the tensor path: `tensor split: 1 devices, estimated use
  26503 MiB vs. 31376 MiB target`, no changes needed, 19.2 t/s, 0 OOM and 0 growth.
* `scripts/validate-set.sh` green (strict 16/16 `git am` on a fresh `ebbb18522`, applied tree
  `8a80535e5`), and patches `0006`-`0015` changed (block 06 in content, 07-15 in `From`/`index` lines only).

**Carried limitations** (from the campaign record): the estimate is deliberately conservative rather
than exact, and the default 1 GiB/device margin absorbs the measured ~0.4 GiB/device error on 27B Q8_0;
block 15's FA **prefill staging arena** is not counted by either fit (bounded, RDNA4/RDNA3_0 only, and
issue #33's `fattn_stage_try_get` fallback degrades to the native K/V read instead of failing); and a
user-pinned lopsided `-ts` lowers the effective budget, which the fit log makes visible.

## 2026-09-21 — docs pass: adaptive-MTP ceiling caveat, ROCm 7.2 toolchain caveat, generator idempotency verified

No delivery block changed (`release.json` stays `v16-ebbb18522-r11`; `patches/` is untouched).

**Adaptive-MTP `ceiling 12` is shape-dependent, and the benchmark docs said otherwise.**  The two
benchmark documents recommended ceiling 12 unconditionally, but that number was measured on UD-Q4_K_XL
on **one card**; on a Q8_0 27B with a 2-card `-sm tensor` split it *loses* to 7 (n7 95.1 -> n12 89.6
t/s, -5.8 % on the code prompt, depth 10 between the two but still below 7).  A caveat now sits after
the ceiling paragraph in `benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md` and in the four-axis record's
"Beware" list in `benchmarks/README.md`, with the practical split (single card ~9, multi-GPU 6-7) that
`README.md`'s "Recommended configuration" *Cap* bullet already carried.  This closes TODO item 22's
"Interim" action; the underlying per-shape tuning stays rejected as not Pareto-safe (the 2026-09-18
resolution), so this is guidance, not a controller change.

**Toolchain caveat recorded.**  A report that ROCm **7.2.4** breaks greedy purity where 7.14 is clean is
still untriaged, so it is recorded as a caveat rather than a claim: `CONTAINERS.md` now states that
7.14.1 is the toolchain the delivery's claims are measured on and that `rocm-7.2` is published but
suspect for speculative decoding and for hash comparisons.  Promote to a finding only if it reproduces
here.

**`generate_cu_files.py` is idempotent; the TODO note claiming otherwise is stale.**  TODO item 11's side
finding said `SOURCE_MMQ_GATE` "re-emits the file header when appending", so re-running the generator
would mutate the 5 committed gate instance files.  It now does not: `SOURCE_MMQ_GATE` is the single line
`DECL_MMQ_CASE_GATE({type});\n` and the header comes from the earlier `'w'` pass over `TYPES_MMQ`, so the
`'a'` pass appends only that declaration.  Verified by running the generator in a throwaway copy of
`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/template-instances/` and diffing against the committed set: **0 changed files, 0 new
files**.  That invariant matters more than it looks, because the r6 build-time split made those instance
files part of block 13/15's patches, so a non-idempotent generator would produce spurious delivery diffs
on the next regeneration.  The check is cheap and is now noted in TODO item 11 as a regression guard.

## 2026-09-20 (r11) — `v16-ebbb18522-r11`: the compute reserve accounts for the reachable (packed) kq mask

**Release** `v16-ebbb18522-r11`, canonical tip `eabb7418df317d1d1b45d65faf1b235c6b43643d`, net tree
`865ded736155407c3a02f5249df356ed1a35fb56`.  Only **block 15** changed; blocks 00-14 are
content-identical to r10 (their patch files are byte-identical, `From <sha>` included — only `0015`
changes).

**The bug (issue #42).**  `llama-server` with the reporter's settings (`--fit on --fit-target 256 -b 2048
-ub 512 -fa on -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 --spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3 -np 1 --cache-ram 16384
--cache-reuse 256`, model `ukisai/Swift-Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:Q4_K_S` = `qwen35`, M-RoPE + mmproj), after
~120k tokens of context, sent an image: `failed to decode image` / `failed to process mtmd chunk`, and
the following request aborted in `ggml_backend_tensor_alloc`.  Root cause: **V3's derived kq mask is a
per-*batch* decision**.  `kq_mask_derivable()` rejects 2-D (M-RoPE) batches and multi-sequence batches
(the `n_kv % 256` gate is *not* a runtime variable — `get_n_kv()` pads to 256 cells, see below); for
those the packed mask (`n_kv*n_tokens*2` bytes) is allocated — but `sched_reserve()` measured with the
derived form on, so the reserved compute buffer did not contain it.  At depth that is hundreds of MiB,
so the first such batch had to grow the buffer mid-run, and with the fit's 256 MiB headroom that growth
failed.  The failed reserve also left `ggml_gallocr`'s layout describing buffers it no longer had, which
is what asserted on the next request.

**Reproduced on gfx1100 (RX 7900 XTX, 24 GiB)** with the reporter's exact model and settings — deep
prefill (~152k tokens) then an image appended at depth: reserve **122.80 MiB**, the image batch needs
**271.53 MiB** (the delta is exactly the packed mask, `152320 x 512 x 2`, i.e. the 152208-token prefix
rounded up to the 256-cell padding — so the *image* batch is the one that cannot be derived),
`cudaMalloc failed: out of memory`, HTTP 500; a following request asserted.

**The fix (block 15).**  `llama_context::graph_reserve()` takes an explicit `packed_kq_mask` argument;
when set, the measure graph is built with `cparams.kq_mask_derived = false`, so the reserved buffers
contain the packed mask at its worst case (`n_ctx x n_ubatch x 2`) and the runtime growth cannot happen.
Which reserves set it comes from the new `llama_context::kq_mask_packed_reachable()`, and that predicate
is the interesting part: the mask only needs reserving where a batch the derived form cannot serve is
actually **reachable** — 2-D M-RoPE (only an M-RoPE model can produce one: `is_pos_2d()` is `n_pos >= 3`
and `n_pos_per_embd()` is 4 only for MROPE/IMROPE) or `n_seq_max > 1` (multi-sequence batches), plus
alibi as belt-and-braces.  Every *other* packed-mask source already keeps the mask in the reserve, which
is what makes the predicate narrow rather than a list: the `allow_derived == false` builders (MLA /
lightning indexer / MSA) never take the derived branch, alibi / multi-stream / FA-off disable the derived
form globally via `resolve_fused_ops()`'s probe, and `n_kv % 256 == 0` is guaranteed because
`llama_kv_cache::get_n_kv()` pads with `GGML_PAD(cells.used_max_p1(), max(n_pad, 256))`.

That last point was checked empirically, because an earlier hypothesis that a text batch at an
off-256-stride append position also needs the packed mask turned out to be **wrong**: a text-only
multi-turn probe on gfx1100 logged **380 DERIVED / 20 PACKED**, every PACKED one `n_tokens <= 8` (whose
mask is a few MiB and fits the reserved slack), and every prefill graph DERIVED — including the appended
chunk.  The fused-op support probes deliberately keep the derived form (the `LLM_FUSED_OP_FLASH_ATTN_DERIVED`
probe requires the derived node to be *present* in its graph), and the public `llama_graph_reserve()` ext
API is unchanged.  Per-batch runtime behaviour is untouched: derivable batches still take the derived
kernel, non-derivable ones take the packed-mask kernel upstream already ships.

**Measured.**  Pre-fix: image-at-depth -> `allocating 271.53 MiB ... cudaMalloc failed: out of memory`
+ `failed to process mtmd chunk` (HTTP 500).  Post-fix, the identical run: **zero** growth/OOM/assert
events, image decoded in 1281 ms, HTTP 200, and text-only + image follow-up requests both succeed (the
allocator is intact).  Same-seed greedy output is **byte-identical** pre vs post
(`620cbe029ab2679408b591c73bde730a154a091361a80611e63374d850a64489`, with `-c 32768 --fit off` pinned
so the changed fit cannot confound it), on both the derived (text) and packed/2-D (image) paths.
Throughput unchanged: prompt eval **963.65 -> 963.57 t/s**, decode **38.81 -> 38.71 t/s**, 152k-token
prefill **267.7 -> 267.9 s**.

The cost is now paid only where the mask is reachable, not by everyone.  The reporter's M-RoPE model
pays, as it must: `ROCm0` **122.80 -> 258.02 MiB**, `ROCm_Host` **20.80 -> 210.02 MiB**, and `--fit`
gives up **8960 tokens of context** (`n_ctx` 203520 -> 194560, **-4.4 %**) on the 24 GiB card.  A
non-M-RoPE single-sequence model does **not**: gemma4-E4B keeps the derived reserve at **113.94 MiB**,
against **146.80 MiB** with `LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED=0` — so V3's *reserved*-memory win (`n_ubatch x n_ctx
x 2`) stands wherever the packed mask is unreachable, and is only surrendered where it can appear.

**Also in this release (block 15, `ggml-alloc.c`).**  A failed `ggml_gallocr_reserve_n_impl()` now
clears a new `galloc->layout_valid`, so the next `ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph()` re-reserves instead of
reusing a layout whose buffers are NULL/stale.  An out-of-memory therefore becomes a clean
`GGML_STATUS_ALLOC_FAILED` (`failed to allocate graph`, the request fails and the server survives)
instead of a NULL-vbuffer dereference or an out-of-bounds assert, and a retry after the memory is freed
can succeed.  No steady-state cost.  The buffer-growth message was promoted from `GGML_LOG_DEBUG`
(compiled out in Release, which made a failed growth unattributable) to `GGML_LOG_INFO`.

`scripts/validate-set.sh` green (strict 16/16 `git am` on a fresh `ebbb18522`, applied tree
`865ded73`).

## 2026-09-20 (r10) — `v16-ebbb18522-r10`: block 11 classifies MoE decode splits correctly, so HIP graphs replay again

**Release** `v16-ebbb18522-r10`, canonical tip `385e0c77cbc34a01707b2efc25adb684c0dcbbc1`, net tree
`9f9602e6e5751ca1e065b80ec3764fdfe6ca6eba`.  Only **block 11** changed; blocks 00-10 are
content-identical to r9 (patch bodies unchanged, `From <sha>`/`index` lines move with the rebuild),
and blocks 12-15 are unchanged in content but carry new commit SHAs because they sit above block 11.

**The bug (issue #41).**  Block 11's pre-fill test was `cgraph->nodes[0]->ne[1] > 1`.  With expert
offload (`-ncmoe`) the scheduler splits the graph around the CPU-resident experts, so a **one-token**
decode split routinely starts on an expert-path tensor `[n_ff, n_expert_used, 1]` and
`ne[1] == n_expert_used` (10) even at one token.  Every MoE decode split was therefore classified as
pre-fill, `use_cuda_graph` was forced false, and decode never captured, warmed up or replayed a HIP
graph.  This is present in the delivery as shipped and needs no upstream expert-cache PR to trigger
(the reporter's #27861 stash is incidental to it).

**Reproduced and fixed on the reporter's exact model** (gfx1201, Qwen3.8-Flash-Next UD-Q4_K_XL,
`-ngl 99 -ncmoe 48 -b 2048 -ub 2048 -c 8192 -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0`, one GPU): the r9 tree logged **0**
`CUDA graph warmup complete` and **0** `CUDA Graph id … reused` events for the whole run; the amended
block 11 logs **50** warmups and **687** replays in a 16-token decode and takes `tg` **10.6 -> 12.8
t/s** (~+20 %; a second pair 10.3 -> 12.9).  Greedy output is byte-identical old vs new, pre-fill is
unchanged, and a dense 4B run is unchanged (1 warmup / 22 replays, same `tg`, same text).  The r9
observation that `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_GRAPHS=1` made no difference to MoE decode was this bug.

**The fix** (block 11 only, `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/ggml-cuda.cu`): a new
`ggml_cuda_graph_is_multi_token()` reads the token count from the first op that actually carries it —
`MUL_MAT_ID`'s `ne[2]` (`[n_out, n_expert_used, n_tokens]`), or a weight `MUL_MAT`'s `src1->ne[1]`
(the result is `[src0->ne[1], src1->ne[1], …]`) — with the old `nodes[0]->ne[1]` test kept as the
fallback for a split with no weight matmul.  The `MUL_MAT` arm requires a constant, unbatched weight
(`src0` op `NONE`, `ne[2] == 1`) so it is not fooled by attention-score matmuls.

**The leak guard that must travel with it.**  Once decode recaptures regularly, the existing
`hipGraphExecUpdate` call leaks device memory on ROCm <= 10.0: the driver's `GraphKernelArgManager`
bump-allocates a kernarg slot per update and only reclaims slots on `hipGraphExecDestroy`
(ROCm/rocm-systems#10713; the driver fix, PR #11434, is still unmerged).  `ggml_cuda_graph_update_executable()`
now destroys and re-instantiates the exec on HIP instead of updating it; this runs only on the
recapture path, and `GGML_HIP_GRAPH_FORCE_UPDATE=1` keeps the update path available for a ROCm that
carries the driver fix.  The leak itself could not be independently measured on this host — ROCm
7.14.1's `rocm-smi`/`amd-smi` counters here report ~57 MB while the process holds ~8.2 GB, so they are
blind to the driver pool — but the workaround is the reporter's validated one and a 1500-token soak
ran clean with it.

## 2026-09-19 (r9) — `v16-ebbb18522-r9`: V3's derived kq mask reaches the tile FA kernel

Follow-up to the r8 finding.  r8 *reported* the head-cap case (a head above the per-arch WMMA cap
selects the tile kernel, which had no derived arm, so V3 was disabled); the maintainer asked for the
cause to be fixed rather than explained, and for the tile path's own performance to be protected.

**Why the tile path mattered.**  The head caps are RDNA4 576 / RDNA3_5 320 / RDNA3_0 256, so the whole
**gemma4** family (head 512) takes the **tile** kernel for prefill on gfx1100 and gfx1151 — the two
arches the V3 memory win was documented for — and those configurations were getting nothing from it.
On those arches the tile kernel is also the *faster* choice at head 512 (r5: 3.5-10 % over MMA on
gfx1100), so "just use the MMA kernel" was never the answer.

**The implementation** (4 files, ~60 lines; block 15 only): `kq_derived_t` moves to
`fattn-common.cuh` so both kernels share one definition; the tile kernel's single mask read site gets
the derived arm; `launch_fattn_tile_switch_ncols2`'s `use_gqa_opt` learns the MMA kernel's `has_mask`
notion, because a derived op leaves `src[3]` **null** (`build_attn_mha` sets `kq_mask = nullptr`) and
the old predicate would have chosen a different `ncols2` than the packed path for the same shape — a
numerics change, not just a path change; and `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_supported` accepts derived on
TILE as well as MMA_F16 (VEC stays rejected: decode/verify-only, unreachable for a derived op).

**Two traps were live**, both worth remembering.  The tile kernel's read guard `(ncols2 > 1 || mask)`
is **false** for `ncols2 == 1` with a derived op, i.e. it would have run the attention *unmasked* —
silent, no crash.  The derived test is now taken **before** that guard rather than folded into it, so
the trap cannot come back through the GQA-optimised variants.  The general lesson for any future
kq-mask work: `mask == nullptr` does not mean "no mask".  The second trap is the `use_gqa_opt`
predicate above.  Unlike the MMA kernel, the tile kernel reads the packed mask straight from global
memory (no shared staging), so the arm needed no loader or staging change at all.

**The decode cost, and the fix that turned out to be enough.**  Decode and the spec verify batch
*always* take the tile kernel (the chooser's WMMA branch requires `ne[1] > 8`), so the derived arm sits
on the latency path of every configuration on every arch — including head-256 models whose prefill is
MMA and which therefore gain nothing from the feature.  The first cut tested
`derived.cell_pos != nullptr` **inside** the unrolled KV loop; that made the compiler rematerialize the
three extra parameters instead of keeping them in registers in a register-bound kernel, and cost
**-0.48 % / -0.79 %** `tg128` (3 alternating rounds of `-r 10`, non-overlapping sets) plus -0.69 % on
gfx1100.  Hoisting the test to once per query row recovers it exactly (r8 vs r9: **+0.01 %** gfx1201,
**+0.02 %** gfx1100, flat on gfx1151), so the planned `use_kq_derived` **template split was not
needed** — which matters because it would have grown the tile instance set by roughly 40 %, and r6 had
just spent a release on build time.  Worth recording that the first hypothesis (register pressure from
the extra parameters) was wrong: the cheap code-shape fix was sufficient, and the kernel's register
count is the same either way.  A related measurement from the same session, since it informs the FA
policy: on gfx1201 the tile kernel is 6-10 % behind MMA for head-512 prefill and level on decode, while
on gfx1100 the ordering flips — which is exactly what the per-arch caps encode.

**Results** (bit-identical: `LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED=1` vs `0`, same-seed greedy text via
`scripts/extract-generated.py`):

* all 8 KV types on gfx1201 (tile forced), and f16/bf16/q8_0/q4_0 on each of gfx1151 and gfx1100,
  where head-512 gemma4 now selects tile **naturally** and enables the mask with no env (r8 warned
  here instead);
* controls: the MMA path is unchanged *and* yields a different text from the tile runs (708 chars
  `0229d81902b8` vs 701 `cc9d5ce277d4`), so the derived==packed results are not vacuous;
* prefill derived-on vs off on the tile path: gfx1100 gemma4-12B pp512 **+1.18 % @16k, +0.86 % @32k**;
  gfx1151 **+1.60 % / +1.72 % @16k, +0.58 % @32k**; gfx1201 E4B (tile forced) **+2.30 % @d0**, and
  +1.7 % / +2.3 % on the 3-GPU layer split.  The win tracks the mask size, so it is ~zero shallow and
  grows with depth;
* SWA covered (gemma4's window is carried in `tok_lo`/`tok_hi` by the existing host fill);
* `scripts/validate-set.sh` green: strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree `cfb2f9664` == the canonical
  tree.

**Docs fixed in the same pass**: the r8 log note in `src/llama-context.cpp` (its "MMA kernel only"
claim was now false, so it was reworded to say only that neither prefill kernel served the graph), the
README "VRAM vs prefill" section (rewritten: the tile limitation is gone, the tile-path numbers and
the no-decode-cost evidence are in, and the stale-`GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_256=0` advice survives as a pure
performance note), `patches/README.md` (header + this amendment section), `MANIFESTS.md`'s header
(which had drifted at r4), `AGENTS.md`, and the WIP records under `archive/work/kq-derived-tile/`.

## 2026-09-19 (r8) — `v16-ebbb18522-r8`: the V3 derived-mask disable now explains itself

Follow-up to r7.  A user running Qwen3.8-Flash-Next on 3x gfx1201 with a stale
`GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_256=0` (a fixed env from the September qwen4exp gates,
`archive/work/qwen4exp/HANDOVER.md`) saw

```
W resolve_fused_ops: derived kq mask flash attention not supported, set to disabled
```

and reasonably read it as "the feature we added for this model does not work here".  Two findings:

* **The mechanism.**  `GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_256=0` sets `wmma_max_head = 128`, so the chooser returns
  `BEST_FATTN_KERNEL_TILE` for head 256.  The derived mask is implemented by the MMA kernel only
  (`fattn.cu`), so the derived FA node has no backend, the scheduler moves it to the CPU, and the probe
  disables V3.  Reproduced locally on a head-256 model; the duplicated lines are the main and
  MTP-draft contexts each resolving it.  `--no-kv-unified` is *not* a factor (with `--parallel 1` the
  cache is single-stream, so `kq_mask_derivable` passes).
* **The env var is also expensive.**  On gfx1201 head 256 the tile kernel is **3x slower at deep
  prefill** than the default WMMA path (9B, `-r 3`, derived off so the effects do not mix:
  `-d 98304` 2104 -> 710 t/s, `-d 32768` 3370 -> 1608, `-d 0` 4844 -> 4651).  So the stale env cost
  both the feature and most of the prefill speed.

**What changed (block 15, +12 lines):** when a `require_kq_derived` probe is disabled, the resolve
probe now adds a line naming the cause (the derived mask is MMA-kernel-only; the tile kernel is
selected for this head via the per-arch WMMA cap, `GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_256=0` or `_MAX_HEAD`) instead
of leaving the generic "missing support" text to point at the device.  The README section on the
knob documents the interaction.

**Correction recorded for the reader:** on qwen4exp the deep-context mask elision (the code's
"-800 MiB win") is the **QSA** derived visibility (`GGML_QSA_DERIVED_VIS`), independent of V3; V3 only
serves that model's dense shortcut (`n_kv <= indexer_top_k + r - 1` = 2051), where the mask is small.

Release r8: tip `63e6aa1ff`, tree `bee36f6f9`; only block 15 changed; strict 16/16 `git am`,
`validate-set.sh` green.

## 2026-09-19 (r7) — `v16-ebbb18522-r7`: block-15 V3 derived-mask kernel shape (issue #30)

Issue #30's second report (@a-n-t-0, 2x RX 7900 XTX / gfx1100, 27B Q8_0, f16 KV) found
`LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED=0` recovering **+5.7 % (tensor) / +13.2 % (layer)** deep prefill at 100k.  A
three-arch A/B (`archive/work/kq-mask-derived-ab/`, 16 configs, `-r 3`, gfx1201 + gfx1151 + gfx1100)
reproduced it and showed the effect is **sign-unstable across arch *and* model config**, not an arch
gate:

| PP512, derived=1 minus =0 | d0 | 32k | 64k | 98k |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| gfx1201 9B 1 GPU | +0.5 | +1.6 | +1.1 | **+2.6** |
| gfx1201 9B 2 GPU tensor | -2.2 | +2.6 | — | **+7.7** |
| gfx1201 27B 2 GPU layer | -0.1 | -3.0 | — | **-6.0** |
| gfx1201 27B 2 GPU tensor | -1.5 | -0.6 | — | +0.7 |
| gfx1151 9B 1 GPU | +0.1 | -0.5 | -0.9 | -1.9 |
| gfx1100 9B 1 GPU | +0.8 | -1.7 | -2.3 | **-3.5** |

**TG128 is flat everywhere** — the derived gate is prefill-only (`n_tokens <= 8` keeps the packed
mask), so there is no decode-side trade.  The derived form forces the MMA kernel (`fattn.cu`), and the
cost was in `flash_attn_ext_f16_load_mask`: the derived branch did **one cell per thread step with a
scalar `half` store** (twice the iterations and unvectorised shared stores of the packed fallback, for
strictly less global traffic) and re-read `cell_pos` for **every query row** although the value does
not depend on the row.

**Fix (only block 15 changed).**  Reshape the derived branch to mirror the packed fallback — two cells
per thread step with one `half2` store, `cell_pos` hoisted out of the `j1` loop.  `nbatch_fa % 32 == 0`
so no tail handling is needed.

| config (PP512, `-r 3`) | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| gfx1201 27B 2GPU layer @98k | -5.96 % | -1.62 % |
| gfx1201 9B 1GPU @98k | +2.57 % | **+3.49 %** |
| gfx1151 9B 1GPU @32k | -0.53 % | -0.24 % |
| gfx1100 9B 1GPU @32k / @64k / @98k | -1.65 / -2.31 / -3.47 % | -0.47 / -0.38 / **-0.15 %** |

**Bit-identical.**  Same-seed greedy text `LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED=1` vs `0`: 9B 1 GPU `0e83b43746e7`
both, 27B 2-GPU layer `5ec02413b9c9` both — only the store shape changed, every mask value is the
same, so no purity gate moves.  The reported V3 memory win is `n_ubatch x n_ctx x 2` bytes: measured
**184.02 -> 88.39 MiB** device + **112.02 -> 16.40 MiB** host at `-c 98304` / ub 512 (~96 MiB each;
the campaign's ~800 MiB figure needs ub ~2048).

| `__noinline__` native loader | **135.7 s** | **-1.5..-2.5 % prefill** (f16 KV too), -0.3..-0.6 % decode |
| hybrid (inline q8_0/q4_0, outline the rest) | 168.0 s | q8_0 == full-outline (no recovery) |

The runtime switch *reduced* object size (2.80 -> 2.46 MB) but *raised* compile time: one giant
36-copy CFG (6 unroll x 6 types) optimises more slowly than six specialised functions.  `__noinline__`
is the real compile win but the outlined call sites degrade the kernel's register allocation for
every path, so the native loaders stay `__forceinline__` — the optimiser's cross-inlining is why
they are fast at runtime and slow to compile.  The hybrid does not recover the perf, so it is
strictly worse than either.

**ccache is the answer.**  ccache 4.12.3 caches ROCm clang HIP device objects.  With
`-DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache` (+ the C/CXX launchers; `~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714` now adds
them when `ccache` is on `PATH`, `CCACHE=0` opts out), the script's `rm -rf "$BUILD_DIR"` no longer
costs a recompile of unchanged sources: first build 282.3 s, wiped rebuild of the same sources
**4.2 s** (657/657 compile steps hit).  ccache replays the compiler's own objects, so the cached
build is identical code — `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` 4/4 and `llama-bench` within noise
(pp2048 d0 7548 vs 7489, tg128 d16384 89.51 vs 89.47).  A `fattn-*.cuh` edit still invalidates the
FA group.  See `archive/work/build-time-regression/README.md` and the README/AGENTS build notes.

## 2026-09-18 (r6) — `v16-ebbb18522-r6`: the FA instance build-time fix (blocks 06/13/15)

**Release.** `v16-ebbb18522-r6`, fork point `ebbb18522` (unchanged).  Canonical 16-block tip
**`f1773dc84633e65cf631acbf691c4f9fba89ec14`**, net tree
**`4c7c4e641637797c66c8a6a1cd952533fdcbfa04`**.  Blocks 00-05, 07-12 and 14 are content-identical to
r5 (only the `From <sha>`/`index` lines moved because this rebuild has its own commit SHAs); the real
deltas are **block 06** (`generate_cu_files.py` + 126 added / 21 deleted `fattn-mma*.cu` + the
backend source-order prepend), **block 13** (`mmq.cuh` extern gate declarations + the generator
`SOURCE_MMQ_GATE` fix + 4 `mmq-instance-*.cu` gate lines) and **block 15** (the tile per-KV-type
split: 96 added / 12 deleted `fattn-tile*.cu`).  Strict 16/16 `git am` re-verified on a fresh
`ebbb18522` tarball (`scripts/validate-set.sh` green: checksums, base tree, applied tree).

**Why.**  The delivery's own FA instantiations had become the build's critical path: block 15's
native-KV arm chain in `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_mma_f16_case` instantiates the whole WMMA kernel
once per KV type **inside every generated MMA instance TU**, so each 8-case `fattn-mma*` file was
~200 s and one TU gated the backend build (`archive/work/build-time-regression/`).  The r5 tile-macro fix had
already moved the tile type axis into the generated files; this release does the same for the MMA
head axis and the tile KV-type axis, and puts the heaviest instances **first** in the backend source
order.

**Measured** (gfx1201, 16 cores, clean `cmake --build --target ggml-hip -j16`, same base):

| state | wall |
|---|---|
| before (21 MMA TUs, worst 216 s) | **323.4 s** |
| MMA per-head split (126 TUs) | 266.6 s |
| + tile per-KV-type split (96 TUs) | 276.8 s *(worse: the big MMA TUs now start even later)* |
| + `dkq512` source-order prepend | **239.0 / 239.2 s** |
| + `mmq` gate instantiations moved out of `mmq.cu` | **235.97 s** (−27 %) |

The decisive change is the **order**, not the split: object mtimes show the six `dkq512` MMA TUs
starting at t=80-150 s and ending at the wall before; with the prepend they start at t=0-4 s and
finish at t≈140 s.  `mmq.cu.o` shrank **9.1 → 1.0 MB**.  A heavy-first goal list piped to
`make -f .../build.make` was tried first and is **not** the fix (that is a build invoker, not the
delivery); the source-order prepend reproduces the gain through the normal `cmake --build` path.

**Build-time only.**  Source-level: the explicit instantiation sets are identical — **126 MMA and 96
tile cases before and after, zero duplicates** — and the linked-library symbol sets are identical.
Gates: `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **4/4 backends**, `-o MUL_MAT_ID_FUSION` **28/28** (the
block-13 gate path), clean build with zero errors.  No runtime or device-code change.

**Storage note.**  The box's `/home` is a USB SSD and `/tmp` is tmpfs; a fresh out-of-source build
in `/tmp` took **237.9 s vs 236.0 s**, i.e. the build is compiler/CPU-bound, not I/O-bound (clang
already stages intermediates in `/tmp`).  The three NVMe drives are Windows installs and are not
available under Linux.

**Also fixed (pre-existing generator wart).**  `generate_cu_files.py` did not reproduce the checked-in
`mmq-instance-*.cu` files (it appended a duplicate `#include`), and only `q3_k` carried
`DECL_MMQ_CASE_GATE` while the other four gate types were silently implicit in `mmq.cu`.  Block 13 is
amended to declare the gate cases `extern` in `mmq.cuh` and define them in the per-type files, which
makes the generator idempotent (`DECL_MMQ_CASE_GATE` is now the append-only line) **and** moves five
instantiations out of the monolithic `mmq.cu`.

**Option (b) deferred at r6, then rejected (2026-09-18).**  Making the WMMA loader's KV type a runtime
dispatch removes the 6-8x code duplication but was measured to make the build *slower* (304 s) or, as
`__noinline__`, cost a universal 1.5-2.5 % prefill (see the build-process entry above).  The loaders
stay force-inlined; ccache is the sanctioned build-speed answer.

## 2026-09-18 (r5) — `v16-ebbb18522-r5`: RDNA3_0 (gfx1100) WMMA FA is capped at head 256 (issue #30)

**Release.** `v16-ebbb18522-r5`, fork point `ebbb18522` (unchanged).  Canonical 16-block tip
**`d82d07a312dbc3d5df945b36cbb893784f0f31cf`**, net tree **`06b89471790c52d7afa32f75755fb1b3b22edada`**;
blocks 00-03 and 05-15 are content-identical to r4 (`b84b1783f…`), the tree delta is the `fattn.cu`
hunk in block 04 (one value + comment; the rebase replayed block 08 over the amended comment so its
`fattn.cu` hunks shift).  Strict 16/16 `git am` re-verified on a fresh `ebbb18522` tarball
(`scripts/validate-set.sh` green: checksums, base tree, applied tree).

**Why (the r4 follow-up).**  The r4 amendment fixed the *tensor-split* half of the RDNA4-tuned
2026-09-14 change but left the other half.  The 2026-09-14 RDNA prefill tuning had also copied
upstream #28102's **RDNA4/gfx1201** config rows for heads 320/512/576 into the **RDNA3_0** branch of
`ggml_cuda_fattn_mma_get_config_rdna`, and lifted the RDNA3_0 WMMA head cap from stock's 256 to 576.
Neither was re-validated on gfx1100, and head 512 then took WMMA where stock takes the tile kernel.

**Measured** (single RX 7900 XTX, gfx1100, ROCm 7.14; gemma-4-26B-A4B UD-Q4_K_XL head 512,
`pp2048 @ d98304`, 2-3 reps):

| K/V type | r4 (RDNA4 #28102 row, WMMA) | pre-2026-09-14 base row (WMMA) | tile kernel (r5) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| f16  | — | 791.0 | 818.7 |
| bf16 | 655.9 | 774.6 | 851.1 |
| q8_0 | 661.4 | 784.0 | 772.8 |

r4 was **-14 % (q8_0) / -23 % (bf16)** below the tile kernel.  Restoring the base row recovers q8_0
but still leaves bf16 9 % low, so the regression is the WMMA *kernel choice* for head 512, not just
the row values.  Tile is stock's choice there, and it must not extend downward: forcing tile on the
9B dense head-256 model costs `pp2048` 1780 -> 1232 t/s at d65536 and 1407 -> 929 at d98304
(**+44-52 % for WMMA**).

**Fix.**  Block 04, `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn.cu`:
`wmma_256 && GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3_0(cc) ? 256` (was `576`).  RDNA4 (576) and RDNA3_5 (320) are
untouched; `GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_MAX_HEAD` still overrides the cap.  Head > 256 *prefill* (`n_q > 8`) on
gfx1100 now takes the tile kernel; the decode/verify band (`n_q <= 8`) already took tile, so the
greedy-purity band invariant is untouched.

**Verification (gfx1100).**  `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5952/5952**; gemma-4-26B-A4B
`pp2048` d0/d65536/d98304 q8_0 **3635.7 / 1051.3 / 778.2** (was 3480 / 906 / 661), bf16
**3627.7 / 1139.6 / 853.3** (was — / 895 / 656), f16 **3660.4 / 1112.8 / 818.2**; dense 9B (head 256)
q8_0 `@ d98304` **1404.7** (WMMA retained, no regression); same-seed greedy output coherent.

**Related finding (documented, not changed).**  On gfx1100 the block-15 q8_0 native arm costs ~5 % of
gemma-4-26B-A4B head-512 deep prefill (`GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE=0` recovers 773 -> 813 t/s at d98304,
stock 810) but buys **+44 %** decode at d65536 (tg128 109.9 vs 76.4 with native off; stock 71.5), so it
stays on.  The dense head-256 model shows no prefill difference (1405.9 vs 1404.4).  A future fix
would keep the native decode path and restore node-scratch F16 staging for prefill on RDNA3_0.

## 2026-09-18 (r4) — `v16-ebbb18522-r4`: RDNA3_0 (gfx1100) keeps the stock FA `ncols2` under tensor split (issue #30)

**Release.** `v16-ebbb18522-r4`, fork point `ebbb18522` (unchanged).  Canonical 16-block tip
**`ba9e18cacfa3f97f13a822dded971eeb2cce2480`**, net tree **`b84b1783f7207e25600403df5a8e98c183b9f80a`**;
blocks 00-03 and 05-15 are content-identical to r3 (`3f3dfcfaa…`), the tree delta is the `fattn.cu`
hunk in block 04 (one condition + its comment; the later blocks' `fattn.cu` hunks shift by the five
added lines).  Strict 16/16 `git am` re-verified on a fresh
`ebbb18522` tarball (`scripts/validate-set.sh` green: checksums, base tree, applied tree).

**Issue.**  [#30 comment](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/issues/30#issuecomment-5735239749)
(@a-n-t-0, 2× RX 7900 XTX / gfx1100, `-sm tensor`): the 2026-09-14 split-aware `ncols2` (the
`ggml_set_fa_tensor_parallel` frontend hint switches tensor-split ATTENTION to the wider generic
`ncols2 = 8`) was tuned on RDNA4.  On RDNA3_0 it costs deep prefill: `pp100K` 667.5 vs stock 805.0
t/s (crosses stock between 8K and 32K), while decode stays ahead of stock.  Changing only
`if (amd_wmma_available(cc) && !tensor_parallel)` to `if (amd_wmma_available(cc))` recovers `pp100K`
to 779.4 / `pp65536` 940.4 / `pp32768` 1152.2 t/s with `tg128` unchanged.

**Fix.**  Block 04, `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn.cu`:
`const bool tensor_parallel = ggml_get_fa_tensor_parallel() && !GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3_0(cc);` — RDNA3_0
always takes the stock AMD rule (minimize wasted compute); RDNA4/RDNA3_5 keep the split-aware
behaviour.  A single gfx1100 card already had `tensor_parallel == false` (`n_cuda_dev == 1`), so the
change is a no-op there.

**Verification.**  RDNA4 (3× R9700): the guard is constant-false for gfx1201, and measured as
equivalent — same-seed greedy text bit-identical for `-sm tensor` (`c3b81052c480`) and `-sm layer`
(`4b8de6d3c871`), `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` 5952/5952, `llama-bench -d 100000` pp4096 parity across interleaved
runs (pre 4300.18/4298.13, post 4297.12/4298.27).  RDNA3_0 single RX 7900 XTX (9B Q8_0, `-d 100000`):
pre- and post-fix binaries in the same band (pp4096 1367-1398 t/s) and both ahead of the stock
`ebbb18522` build (1351.0/1344.7); `tg128` 62.94 vs stock 59.89.  The gfx1100 **tensor-split** mode is
community-validated (the reporter's dataset); it cannot be exercised on a single card.

## 2026-09-18 (r3) — `v16-ebbb18522-r3`: the `--fit` SIGSEGV with `draft-mtp-adaptive` (issue #38)

**Release.** `v16-ebbb18522-r3`, fork point `ebbb18522` (unchanged).  Canonical 16-block tip
**`3d71f34794b2ec929ac92314e0091722c478956b`**, net tree **`3f3dfcfaa1795e9bd475d56ea695b90daea5b5fa`**;
blocks 00 and 02-15 are content-identical to r2 (`7dc63cb3c…`), the tree delta is the one-line
`common/common.cpp` hunk in block 01.  Strict 16/16 `git am` re-verified on a fresh `ebbb18522`
tarball (`scripts/validate-set.sh` green: checksums, base tree, applied tree).

**Issue.**  [#38](https://github.com/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/issues/38): `--spec-type
draft-mtp-adaptive` with a *minimal* per-tier MTP head (the shipped `mtp-Qwen3.8-27B-Q4_0.gguf`,
qwen35, 18 tensors) SIGSEGVs during startup in the `--fit` probe (`common_params_fit_impl` →
`common_get_device_memory_data_impl` → `llama_init_from_model` → `sched_reserve` → `resolve_fused_ops`
→ `graph_reserve` → `build_qkvz` → `build_lora_mm` → `ggml_mul_mat` with a null operand).
`--spec-type draft-mtp` with the same head, and `--fit off`, both work.  Reproduced here on 2× R9700
(gfx1201) with Qwen3.8-27B-EfficientThink-SimPO-Q8_0 + the minimal head: `-sm layer` crashes,
`-sm tensor` does not crash **because `common_params_fit_impl` aborts for `LLAMA_SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR`**
(documented: `docs/multi-gpu.md` says `--fit` is unsupported with `tensor`; `common/fit.cpp` is
upstream code and no delivery block modifies it — see the TODO note below).

**Root cause.**  Block 01 added `COMMON_SPECULATIVE_TYPE_DRAFT_MTP_ADAPTIVE` and switched the
detection sites to `params.speculative.has_mtp()`, but the fit path in `common_init_result` kept the
pre-adaptive manual find for `COMMON_SPECULATIVE_TYPE_DRAFT_MTP` only.  With adaptive, `spec_mtp` was
false, so `cparams_dft.ctx_type` stayed `LLAMA_CONTEXT_TYPE_DEFAULT` and the extra model (the MTP
head) was fitted as a **full model** — the minimal head has no full-model tensors, hence the null
weight.  With plain `draft-mtp`, `ctx_type` was `LLAMA_CONTEXT_TYPE_MTP`, matching what
`common_speculative_init_result` builds at runtime.

**Fix.**  Block 01, `common/common.cpp`: `const bool spec_mtp = params.speculative.has_mtp();`
(one line).  The fit probe now measures the MTP context with the type the runtime will build, so the
adaptive memory estimate matches `draft-mtp`.  No other MTP-only manual find remained in a detection
position (the two left are the `draft-mtp`+`draft-mtp-adaptive` conflict check and the GGUF/sidecar
type inference, both intentional).

**Verification** (2× R9700, Qwen3.8-27B EfficientThink Q8_0 + `mtp-Qwen3.8-27B-Q4_0.gguf`, greedy
`--seed 42 --temp 0`): `-sm layer --spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive` with `--fit` on now exits 0 (was
SIGSEGV); isolation matrix `none`, `adaptive --fit off`, `adaptive --fit on`, `draft-mtp --fit on`,
`adaptive -sm tensor` all exit 0 with the **same greedy text `5dca93fd0986`** (255 chars) — the fix
is greedy-pure against the `--fit off` workaround and plain decode.  The fit probe log confirms the
extra model is now measured at `ctx_type = MTP`.

**TODO (not fixed, upstream scope).**  `--fit` aborting for `-sm tensor` is an upstream limitation
(since fit-params #22171), not a delivery bug: the algorithm is layer-granular (`tensor_split[id] =
ngl_per_device[id].n_layer`, whole-layer fills, whole-tensor CPU overflow), which does not map onto
the shard-every-layer tensor split.  A tensor-split fit would be a new allocator over the
`tensor_split` proportions + `n_ctx`; it belongs under `upstream/` or upstream, not in this block set.

## 2026-09-18 (beta) — `beta/tensor-fit-fix/`: `--fit` for `--split-mode tensor` (upstream candidate)

**No delivery artifact changed** (`release.json` untouched).  A new beta
(`beta/tensor-fit-fix/`) stages a fix for upstream's `--fit` omission under
`-sm tensor`: `common_params_fit_impl` used to throw
`"llama_params_fit is not implemented for SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR"`, so `--fit`
(default on) was a no-op there and users set `-c`/`-ngl`/`-ts` by hand.

Why it was hard: under tensor split all GPUs wrap into one **Meta device**, and
the `no_alloc` `memory_breakdown` for a Meta buft mixes a model *total* with
per-device *maxima* for context/compute, while `ggml_backend_dev_memory(Meta)`
is the device *sum* — the layer-granular fit algorithm and its per-device
accounting do not apply.  The beta exposes the Meta device's simple devices
(`ggml_backend_dev_is_meta` / `ggml_backend_meta_dev_n_devs` /
`ggml_backend_meta_dev_simple_dev`, de-static'ed), then adds a tensor-split
branch that sets `tensor_split[i] ∝ (free_i - margin_i)` (so the loader's
proportional sharding reduces the per-device check to the single budget
`D <= min_i(target_i / ratio_i)`, which is `sum(target)` for the auto split),
estimates total use as `model + n_devices*(context+compute)` (context/compute
are per-device maxima → slightly conservative), and reduces `n_ctx` (auto
context only) then `n_gpu_layers` until it fits.  The extra (draft/MTP) model's
Meta device is a distinct object, so it is measured directly (embedded MTP is
covered by `shares_model`).  **Policy A (maintainer decision 2026-09-18): a
user-pinned `-ts` is honored as a constraint, not an opt-out** — the fit keeps
the requested balance and only chooses `-c`/`-ngl` around it (consistent with
the documented `--fit` = "auto-fit unset args" and with how `-c` is already
treated); it logs the effective budget next to the sum of targets.

Validated on 2 and 3× R9700 gfx1201 with `Qwen3.8-27B-Q8_0` (dense, and
embedded MTP), `Qwen3.8-27B-EfficientThink` + separate `mtp-...-Q4_0` head
(adaptive), and `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Q8_0` (MoE, embedded MTP): fits cases leave
`-c`/`-ngl` and emit proportional `-ts`; `--fit-target 26000,26000` → `-ngl 27`
(dense) / `-ngl 14` (MoE); auto context 262144 → 43264 at a 16000 MiB target;
asymmetric `--fit-target 1024,8000` → `-ts 31254,24278` with real per-device
peak 15925/12018 MiB vs the predicted 15563/12080 (within 3 %).  Pinned splits
are honored and budgeted: `-ts 1,3` → effective budget 41672 MiB
(`min(31254/.25, 31254/.75)`), `-ts 1,20` → 32816 MiB, and `-ts 1,3
--fit-target 26000,26000` → `-ngl 17` (budget 8370).  Reduced configs load and
generate.  The patch applies cleanly to both the delivery tree
and plain upstream `ebbb18522` (offset -1 in `ggml-backend-meta.cpp`).  Record:
`beta/tensor-fit-fix/README.md` + `BETA-TESTING.md`.  Likely home: `upstream/`;
decide later.

## 2026-09-18 — adaptive-MTP controller re-validated; the "current record" doc pointers were stale (docs only)

**No delivery artifact changed** (no patch, `release.json` untouched).  The adaptive-MTP controller was
re-validated against a new **4-prompts-per-axis corpus** (16 prompts + 3 phase-switch) on four cells --
dense Q4_K_XL 1 GPU, MoE 35B-A3B 1 GPU, Q8_0 2-GPU tensor and 3-GPU tensor, plus 2-GPU `-sm layer` --
and against every alternative controller (the PR #27210 table, a sliding-mean rule, a
target-acceptance-rate rule) on one build.  Conclusion: the **credit bucket is the best multi-cell
default and no block-01 change is recommended**; the retunes and the alternative controllers are
dominated or quant-specific.  The `ngram-mod` + adaptive-MTP combo is the best recall configuration
(`--spec-ngram-mod-n-match 45 --spec-draft-n-max 9 --spec-draft-n-start 9`; recall +67.5 %, overall
+13.6 % on Q8_0 2-GPU, reasoning -1.9 %).  Cap guidance: single card ~9, multi-card 6-7.

What was actually wrong: `benchmarks/README.md` and `benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md` called
`2026-09-13-adaptive-mtp-4-axis-n12.md` the "current" four-axis record, but it was measured with the
**pre-tuning table** controller (its prose acceptance 0.50654 is the table's; the delivery bucket's is
0.60232) -- which is why the delivery appeared to underperform its own documented numbers.  Both
pointers now name `2026-09-15-adaptive-mtp-tuning.md` as the current controller record and mark the
2026-09-13 record as the table arm.  Full corpus, sweeps and report:
`archive/work/mtp-journey-2026-09-17/` (WIP, not part of the delivery).

The top-level `README.md` gained a **Recommended configuration** section naming the `ngram-mod` +
adaptive-MTP combo (`--spec-ngram-mod-n-match 45 --spec-draft-n-max 9 --spec-draft-n-start 9`) as the
best general-purpose configuration, with the cap/`n_match` guidance and a pointer to the journey report.

## 2026-09-17 (r2) — `v16-ebbb18522-r2`: FA unroll-warning flood + block-01 comment; CI tag guard

**Release.** `v16-ebbb18522-r2`, fork point `ebbb18522` (unchanged).  Canonical 16-block tip
**`31b1790372d17bf7f95f3e15f7b4e2b35eb661e1`**, net tree **`7dc63cb3c93aa1cd74435698f045f93d2ee3a9e6`**;
strict 16/16 `git am`, build + `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` 5952/5952, coherence gate clean.  Two block amendments
plus a CI fix:

* **Block 15 — the "loop not unrolled" flood is gone.**  A clean build printed **10,362**
  `warning: loop not unrolled ... [-Wpass-failed=transform-warning]` lines, every one from
  `fattn-mma-f16.cuh` (attributed to the kernel's declaration line).  The FA kernels carry bare
  `#pragma unroll` hints on runtime-bounded loops (the K/V staging loop, `fattn-mma-f16.cuh:421`, plus
  the sparse combine path); AMDGPU clang reports every hint it cannot honour.  That is upstream noise,
  but the delivery's native-KV arms instantiate the whole WMMA kernel once per KV type per instance TU,
  which multiplied it.  `ggml/src/ggml-hip/CMakeLists.txt` now appends **`-Wno-pass-failed`** to
  `CMAKE_HIP_FLAGS` (HIP-only; the diagnostic is Clang/AMDGPU).  The hints are advisory and the pass
  already failed, so there is no codegen change -- verified on the worst TU
  (`fattn-mma-f16-instance-ncols1_8-ncols2_4.cu`: **1692 -> 0** warnings), and the rebuilt tree is
  clean apart from upstream's pre-existing `-Wunused-private-field`.  Details and the measurements:
  `archive/work/build-time-regression/README.md`.
* **Block 01 — the adaptive-controller comment no longer contradicts the code.**
  `common/speculative-adaptive.h` documented an ngram-mod acceptance feed ("a strong run by another
  speculator ... climbs the depth one step per round") that `common_speculative_impl_draft_mtp::accept`
  deliberately does **not** do.  The comment now states the actual behaviour and points at the accept()
  site; the delivery's 2026-09-17 investigation measured the old `bucketed-adaptive-mtp` gated feed and
  found it a no-op with the re-tuned controller (`benchmarks/2026-09-17-mtp-ngram-combo.md`).
* **CI — the release tag guard no longer requires a short SHA in `release.json.base`.**  The first
  `v16-ebbb18522-r1` tag push (run 35218177859) failed the prepare job with
  `tag v16-ebbb18522-r1 must match v16-ebbb185227c31f1652f1445e2623563d2f67fe5a-r<N>` because the
  manifest had been generated with the full fork-point SHA.  The data was corrected and the tag re-cut
  (run 35218381572), and `.github/workflows/docker-ghcr.yml` now accepts a tag whose base component is
  a >=7-char **prefix** of the recorded base, so either form works; `scripts/make-release.sh` documents
  the short-form convention.

## 2026-09-17 (re-base onto upstream master `ebbb18522`) — release `v16-ebbb18522-r1`

**Release.** Fork point upstream master **`ebbb18522`** ("openvino : Update OpenVINO to 2026.4; fix
clangd,MSVC warnings", tree `068106dfa23c63668abaea0113a1b38bc1352282`), 37 commits past `d1d3c3396`.
Canonical 16-block tip **`6b1e9ffd1e5aef56534ba5ffe9f515f5ae31118e`**, net tree
**`d751f42d05cc4770189f4a5250cc4aea4fea8e08`**.  `scripts/make-patches.sh` regenerated the set and
`scripts/make-release.sh` refreshed `release.json`; `scripts/validate-set.sh` passes checksums +
strict **16/16 `git am`** on a fresh tarball of `ebbb18522`, applied tree == recorded tree.

**Why a re-base.** Upstream had moved 37 commits past the previous base.  Most blocks replayed
cleanly; three needed resolution:

- **Block 02 — the Vulkan check-results code moved.**  Upstream `f172be756` split `ggml-vulkan.cpp`
  into `ggml-vulkan-{buffers,debug}.cpp` + shared headers.  Block 02's only Vulkan change was the
  `ggml_gated_delta_net(..., K, n_rs_batch)` op-param clone in `ggml_vk_check_results_0`, so it was
  re-homed to the new `ggml-vulkan-debug.cpp`; `ggml-vulkan.cpp` is now untouched by the delivery.
- **Block 12 — upstream enabled the CUDA internal AllReduce on HIP.**  Upstream `38a5b42d9`
  (#27825) changed `allreduce.cu`'s guard from `!GGML_USE_HIP && !GGML_USE_MUSA` to
  `!GGML_USE_MUSA`, added the `cudaHostAlloc`/`hipHostMalloc` vendor aliases, and swapped
  `__nanosleep` for `__builtin_amdgcn_s_sleep` on HIP.  The delivery already ships its own, more
  advanced HIP all-reduce (the tuned hybrid dispatch + the opt-in `ce` copy-engine arm) in
  `allreduce-hip.cu`, so compiling `allreduce.cu` for HIP too would have produced duplicate symbols.
  Resolution: keep the delivery's split — `allreduce.cu` is re-guarded `!GGML_USE_HIP &&
  !GGML_USE_MUSA` (CUDA-only), the `#elif defined(GGML_USE_MUSA)` stubs and the stage-hook stubs are
  kept, and the HIP path stays in `allreduce-hip.cu`.  Upstream's `CUDA_CHECK` cleanups and the hip.h
  aliases are retained (the aliases are unused by the delivery's HIP file, which calls the hip-native
  APIs directly).
- **Block 14 — upstream added the qwen4exp hyper-connection ops.**  Upstream `37b53fd45` (#28901)
  added `ggml_dsv4_hc_pre_gated`/`ggml_dsv4_hc_post` (previously deepseek4-only) to qwen4exp's
  `build_hc_mix`/`build_hc_combine`.  Both sides fuse the same math.  Resolution: the delivery's
  decode/verify-band fused ops (`ggml_hc_mix`/`ggml_hc_combine`, `nt <= HC_FUSED_MAX_TOKENS`) keep
  precedence for the `nt <= 8` band — that is the band-purity guarantee (`plain == draft-mtp`) — and
  upstream's fused ops now serve the prefill path (previously the unfused chain) when `il >= 0`,
  matching upstream's own structure.  The unfused chain remains the last fallback.

**One performance-relevant semantic gap, fixed.**  Upstream `fccf7166f` (#28935) broadened the
standalone MoE MMQ tile heuristic gate in `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q` from `GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3_0` to
`GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3` (a +11 % RDNA3.5/gfx1151 MoE prefill win).  The delivery's pair-fusion arm
(`ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q_pair`, added by block 14) had copied the old `RDNA3_0` gate, so on gfx1151 it
would have sized the fused gate+up pair's tile from the full token count instead of the per-expert
average.  Block 14 is amended to use `GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3`, matching upstream.  The change is a
no-op on RDNA3_0 and RDNA4 (both predicates are true/false identically there), so gfx1201 behaviour
is unchanged; it only removes the RDNA3_5 inconsistency.

**Verification (gfx1201, ROCm 7.14, gfx1201-only build).**  Build clean.  `test-backend-ops`
**18083/18083**, `-o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5952/5952**, `-o FLASH_ATTN_QSA` **22/22**.  Same-seed
coherence gate (`Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0`, `-sm tensor`, 3 GPU) coherent.  Re-base A/B against the previous
delivery build (`8465f08b9`) on the same machine: `tg128` identical (1 GPU 96.13 vs 96.17 t/s;
3-GPU 119.30 vs 119.32 t/s) and prefill equal within run-to-run variation (order-reversed pp4096
runs: rebase 7385.7/7346.5 vs old 7365.8/7332.2 t/s).  No regression.

**MTP revalidation — upstream #28549 (`Enable CUDA graph for MTP draft`) helps us.**  Isolated A/B on
the MTP reference cell (2x R9700 gfx1201, GPUs 1,2 `-sm tensor -ts 1/1`, f16 KV,
`/llm/models/Qwen3.8/27B/Q8_0/Qwen3.8-27B-Q8_0.gguf`, built-in NextN head, adaptive cap 12,
`-n 3000`): reverting just `2f3fd0252` on the re-based tree costs **+0.3 % (reasoning, mean len 2.95),
+0.25 % (prose, 5.10), +0.85 % (code, 7.11), +1.43 % (recall, 11.13)** — a win that scales with draft
depth, with byte-identical acceptance and mean length on every axis.  The PR is host-side
`llama_context` bookkeeping (`gf_res_prev` split by `n_outputs > 0`), so the MTP draft context's
alternating `process()`/`draft()` graphs finally keep a warm, replayable HIP graph; no HIP-specific
work is needed.  Full record + commands: `benchmarks/2026-09-17-mtp-pr28549-ab.md`.  This also
reproduces the recorded 2026-09-16 cell within ~1-2 %.

**`ngram-mod` + `draft-mtp-adaptive` combo measured (2026-09-17 follow-up).**  `--spec-type` argument
order is irrelevant (the impl list is a fixed priority list with ngram-mod before MTP; verified
identical acceptance).  The combo is worth **R +1.2 %, P flat, C +0.6 %, K +72 %** against the MTP-only
default with `--spec-ngram-mod-n-match 45 --spec-draft-n-max 9 --spec-draft-n-start 9` (45, not the
default 24, so ngram-mod fires only on verbatim recall and not on incidental code repeats; `n_match 48`
with a raised start has a reproducible recall cliff).  The old `bucketed-adaptive-mtp` acceptance feed
is **not** in the delivery and re-adding it is a **no-op** with the re-tuned controller (all cases within
noise) — the `common/speculative-adaptive.h` comment that documents the feed is stale and should be
corrected in a block-01 comment amendment.  bf16 KV does not raise acceptance on this cell (native bf16
== staged bf16; both ~2-4 % slower on R/P).  Full record: `benchmarks/2026-09-17-mtp-ngram-combo.md`.

**Not revalidated here (hardware unavailable):** gfx1151 (the block-14 `RDNA3` gate fix and the
qwen4exp MTP purity gates), gfx1100, and the qwen4exp prefill/perplexity path (no qwen4exp model on
this host) — the upstream hc-op change follows upstream's validated path, and the RDNA3.5 gate fix
follows upstream #28935's own gfx1151 measurements.

## 2026-09-16 (adaptive-MTP cold start restored + `--spec-draft-n-start`) — delivery-set update (no version bump)

**Change.** Two delivery amendments, folded into existing blocks (patch set regenerated; `release.json`
hashes/tip/tree refreshed; release tag left at `v16-d1d3c3396-r4`; no tag/GHCR/GitHub Release):

- **Block 01 — adaptive-MTP cold start + `--spec-draft-n-start`.** The cold start is `max(floor, cap - 3)`
  (the tuned default, restored), now overridable per context with `--spec-draft-n-start N` (env
  `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DRAFT_N_START`, clamped to `[--spec-draft-n-min-adaptive, --spec-draft-n-max]`;
  `0`/unset = the default).  The `--spec-draft-n-max > 15` clamp and the `> 7` purity notice remain
  **W-level** notices split into short lines (the `CLAMP=0` keep-anyway branch stays an error);
  `llama-server`'s default INFO threshold shows them, `llama-cli`'s default ERROR threshold hides them
  (`-lv 2`).  `tests/test-speculative-adaptive.cpp` covers the override and the clamp.
- **Block 15 — derived kq mask probe guard** (unchanged from the previous cut).  The V3 support probe
  forces a single-sequence graph; on a multi-stream KV cache that violates deepseek4's stream layout
  (its lid cache keeps per-sequence streams even under `kv_unified`, and `build_lid_top_k` ties the
  indexer query stream count to the cache K's `ne[3]` while the mask uses the plan's), so it is now
  skipped when derived is structurally unreachable (`n_seq_max > 1` without `kv_unified`, or
  `n_seq_max > 1` on deepseek4).  See `patches/README.md` and the block-15 message.

**Finding (2026-09-16).**  The cold start was briefly moved to the midpoint of the floor and the cap
(`(floor + cap) / 2`), on the theory that the `cap - 3` entry point was slowing short reasoning/prose
generations at a deep context.  A same-build comparison (GPUs 1,2, f16 KV, `-n 3000` and `-n 300`,
shallow and ~32k context) shows `cap - 3` is at least as fast in every case: the midpoint costs
reasoning -5.0 %, code -1.9 % and recall -7.5 % on the four-axis gate.  End-to-end throughput tracks
the round count `n/(1+mean_len)`, and the optimized multi-token verify makes a wider batch cheap, so a
lower start only lowers the settled mean depth.  A pinned-depth oracle confirms the controller beats
every fixed depth (reasoning adaptive 60.6 vs best fixed 57.7; prose 80.6 vs 80.4).  The start is
therefore a runtime option, not a constant.  Numbers: `benchmarks/2026-09-16-adaptive-mtp-coldstart.md`.

**Validation.** `test-recurrent-state-rollback-dsv4` and `test-save-load-state` aborted at the
pre-guard delivery HEAD and pass at base `d1d3c3396`; with the guard both pass.  Full `ctest` on the
regenerated tree: **66/67** (the only failure is `test-tokenizers-ggml-vocabs`, environmental — no
`git-lfs` installed, so the cloned vocab files are LFS pointers; it fails at base too).
`scripts/validate-set.sh`: strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree
`3bb7c223c60570978d1bbf996a03808fe31f2842`.

## 2026-09-16 (block-12 r4 amendment) — `v16-d1d3c3396-r4`: opt-in copy-engine (SDMA) all-reduce

**Release.** `v16-d1d3c3396-r4`, fork point `d1d3c3396` (tree `3ce99b5422bf`), canonical 16-block
tip `c08efa1bc35667e4a48af6e26ffab3c8b5500f4a`, net tree
`a4cdb2800d5407656e84104199668c789a486b0a`.  Block 12 is amended; blocks 00-11 and 13-15 are
content-identical, the net change being **+263 lines in `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/ggml-cuda.cu`**
(`git diff --stat 4e942c0715 c08efa1bc` = one file).

**What.**  `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=ce` — a third, **opt-in** all-reduce algorithm: a 2-GPU
**copy-engine (SDMA) P2P all-reduce** built from `cudaMemcpyPeerAsync` on the compute streams plus
cross-device events, instead of NCCL's SM-driven kernels.  It keeps block 12's hybrid structure, so
the internal host-staged pipeline still serves the latency-bound small tensors (decode/verify) and
the new arm only replaces the **large-tensor (prefill)** transport: the decode path is byte-identical
to `hybrid`.  Same dtype policy as the NCCL large path (fp32 -> bf16 reduce -> fp32).  The algorithm
is a general-n reduce-scatter + all-gather with uneven-chunk handling and a double-buffered receive
scratch; the destination peer's receive regions are sender-indexed, so the all-gather needs no wait on
the peer's reduce phase.

**Why it is opt-in.**  `hybrid` stays the **default, unchanged**; `ce` is a beta mode that needs
community soak time before any default decision, which is exactly why it is a separate arm rather
than a change to the hybrid path.  If `ce` cannot be set up (no peer access) it degrades to the
**hybrid** path -- deliberately never to the meta-backend butterfly, which measured **948 t/s** on
3 GPUs against the hybrid's 2376 (a 2.5x cliff).

**Measured** (2x R9700 gfx1201, 27B Q8_0, `-sm tensor`, bf16 KV, `-b/-ub 2048`, delivered tree):

| | `hybrid` (default) | `ce` |
|---|---:|---:|
| pp512 | 1973 | 2019 (**+2.3 %**) |
| pp2048 | 2103-2134 | 2190-2218 (**+4.1 %**) |
| pp4096 | 2082 | 2170 (**+4.2 %**) |
| tg128 | 31.19 | 31.15 (unchanged) |

Greedy text on the prose prompt is identical between `hybrid` and `ce`, and `ce` is
**`plain == draft-mtp` byte-identical** (`16c5d2e75ad8`, 6053 chars).  On 3 GPUs `ce` currently runs
(correct and pure) but is ~6 % *slower* than NCCL in the serialized regime, so the mode is documented
as a 2-GPU win; it is not defaulted anywhere.

**A fixed bug worth naming** (it cost a multi-context crash): a benign
`cudaErrorPeerAccessAlreadyEnabled` from `cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess` is still recorded in the sticky
last-error slot, so it must be followed by `cudaGetLastError()` or the next kernel launch's error
check aborts.  The `ce` init does that.

**Validation.**  `scripts/validate-set.sh` green (checksums + strict 16/16 `git am` on a fresh
tarball at `d1d3c3396`, applied tree == `release.json.tree`); the amended tree builds clean; the
`hybrid` default and the `ce` (decode-unchanged, greedy-identical, MTP-pure) behaviour re-measured on
the delivered tree.  Detail, the design of the follow-on overlap work, and the raw measurements:
`archive/work/q8-prefill-tuning/` (HANDOVER.md, OVERLAP-DESIGN.md).

## 2026-09-15 (release process) — release versioning standardized and enforced

The tag history had drifted from the documented recipe: `CONTAINERS.md` said the release tag is
`v16-<fork-point>`, but amendments added a `-r<N>` suffix, the `v16-d1d3c3396` re-base was never
tagged (its `release.json` says `-r1`), `v16-790cf51aa-r5` was built by a `workflow_dispatch`
(images only — commit `a0d1de70`, no tag and no Release), and two early tags (`v16-790cf51aa`,
`-r2`) never got a Release.  Every tag that *did* exist matched its `release.json.release`, so the
gap was process, not data.

Rule now documented in `CONTAINERS.md` (and `README.md`): one tag per release,
`v16-<fork-point>-r<N>` with `r1` the re-base and each later release on the same base incrementing
`N`; `release.json.release` must be exactly the tag; only a **tag push** cuts a release
(`workflow_dispatch`/`schedule` are image-only and never bump a revision).  The historical
`v16-790cf51aa` tag is the `r1` of its base.  `.github/workflows/docker-ghcr.yml` now fails the
`prepare` job — before any image build — when a pushed tag does not equal `release.json.release`, so
the tag and the manifest can no longer disagree.  `v16-d1d3c3396-r3` (the issue-#33 block-15
amendment) is the first release under the explicit rule.  The guard also rejects a tag that does not
match `v16-<base>-r<N>` for the current base, so the naming pattern itself is enforced, not just the
equality.

## 2026-09-15 (block-15 amendment) — `v16-d1d3c3396-r3`: the FA prefill staging arena degrades instead of aborting

**Release.** `v16-d1d3c3396-r3`, fork point `d1d3c3396` (tree `3ce99b5422bf`), canonical 16-block
tip `4e942c071`, tree `28be875afbdb58f2f842f521ac3ec6764b52cf49`.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` passes
strict 16/16 (`git am`, applied tree == recorded tree).  **Only block 15 changed.**

**Reported (issue #33, @plchldr).**  On a single **7900 XTX (gfx1100)**, Unsloth
`Qwen3.8-27B UD-Q4_K_M` with a quantized K/V cache, `llama-server --fit-target 256` ran upstream but
aborted after a while with
`ROCm error: out of memory ... in function fattn_stage_get ... hipMalloc(&new_arena, new_size)` at the
deep prefill.  Raising the fit target merely deferred it; the demand tracked the prompt length.

**Root cause.**  Block 15's prefill band split stages a native-capable quantized K/V cache to F16 in
per-context, per-stream arena (`ggml_backend_cuda_context::fattn_stage`) that is deliberately **outside
the compute-graph reserve** (the reserve sizes it for `n_ctx`, which is the adaptive-MTP
`-c 196608` load failure the arena removed), and `llama_get_memory_breakdown` therefore never counts
it.  A `--fit` run can thus legitimately leave less free memory than the transient needs; the arena
grows with the prefix, so the shortfall appears part-way through the first deep prefill, and the old
`CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(...))` turned it into a process abort rather than a slowdown.

**What landed (block 15).**  `fattn_stage_get` -> `fattn_stage_try_get`, which returns `nullptr` on a
failed `cudaMalloc` (clearing the sticky error, warning once) instead of aborting; `launch_fattn`
turns a null arena into the **native K/V read** for the operand(s) that would have been staged.  The
native read is the same arithmetic the decode/verify band already uses and is bit-identical to the
staged F16 copy, so this is a prefill slowdown only, never a correctness change -- and it is exactly
what keeps the run inside the memory the fit reserved.  This is the right granularity (the arena's
high-water mark tracks the *actual* prefix, not `n_ctx`), so `--fit` is not made to reserve an
`n_ctx`-sized transient it would otherwise waste.

**Validated (gfx1201, FAIL -> PASS).**  4B Q8_0, `-c 32768`, `-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0`, a 31.5k-token
prefill, with a HIP holder pinning the card to 64 MiB free:

* **pre-fix**: `llama-server` died with `ROCm error: out of memory ... fattn_stage_get`
  (`common.cuh:1667`), client `RemoteDisconnected`;
* **post-fix**: the same run logged
  `fattn_stage_try_get: not enough free device memory for a 30 MiB FA prefill staging buffer, reading the K/V cache natively instead`
  and completed the request **HTTP 200**, with content byte-identical to the staged run.

`test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5952/5952**.  Same-seed greedy text is the reference hash
(`139 chars sha=d2ffb97ccb76`) with staging on, with the static cap forcing native
(`GGML_CUDA_FA_STAGE_MAX_MB=1`), and with the OOM fallback.  `GGML_CUDA_FA_STAGE_MAX_MB` semantics are
unchanged (per-operand cap; above it the native read); the free-memory check is an additional,
per-launch bound.

**Bookkeeping.**  `rdna-boosts-all.patch` was regenerated for the first time since r1 (it had gone
stale in r2, which amended block 01 but did not refresh the single-patch net), so its net now also
contains the r2 block-01 controller.

## 2026-09-15 (block-01 amendment) — `v16-d1d3c3396-r2`: tuned bucketed adaptive-MTP controller

**Release.** `v16-d1d3c3396-r2`, fork point `d1d3c3396` (tree `3ce99b5422bf`), canonical 16-block
tip `f8247e698`, tree `b97cbdd4ab5cb435aaf07373b012fbb4de4d4af6`.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` passes
strict 16/16 (`git am`, applied tree == recorded tree).  **Only block 01 changed.**

**Why.**  The reporter's issue-#35 cell (Qwen3.8-27B **Q8_0 x 2-card `-sm tensor`**, f16 KV,
`-n 3000`) lost ~3.6 % to a lower ceiling: adaptive `--spec-draft-n-max 12` read **92.8 t/s against
96.3** at ceiling 7, while the pinned-depth optimum is **99.0** at depth 10.  The mean-reverting
`climb_threshold`/`drop_pressure` table was tuned for mainline acceptance, and the delivery's higher
acceptance moves the operating point.

**What landed.**  Block 01's controller is replaced by the credit-bucket form (stew675's bucketed
design: `delta = n_accepted - depth`, except that a full accept credits `max(1, n_accepted - 1)`, with
the surplus or deficit carried across a depth change) and tuned:

- `climb_budget(d) = 20 + 6*(d - 1)` — a flat budget let six consecutive full accepts at depth 8
  cascade the depth 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 in 16 rounds, because the credit grows with depth.
- `drop_pressure(d) = max(60, 10*d)` (was `max(20, 4*d)`) — damps the slow 6 <-> 12 limit cycle that
  produced **40 depth changes in 477 verification rounds**.
- cold start `min(cap, max(floor, cap - 3))` (was the floor) — off the floor a step costs ~20 net
  full accepts and the controller burned a third of a 3000-token run reaching the plateau, which is
  the entire advantage of a higher ceiling; settling *down* is cheap even when the equilibrium is the
  floor (the drift is strongly negative there), so a reasoning workload pays almost nothing.
- the depth state transition is reported at **TRC** (it is the user-visible explanation of a run's
  decode throughput) and now carries `n_bucket`; `tests/test-speculative-adaptive.cpp` is rewritten
  against the bucket constants; the `--spec-draft-n-min-adaptive` help/doc wording no longer claims
  it is the starting depth.

**Why the credit function itself needed no tuning.**  The bucket drift's zero-crossing already lands
on the throughput optimum of every workload measured -- code ~9, prose/reasoning/phase-switching at
the floor, verbatim recall at the ceiling -- each confirmed with a pinned-depth sweep.  The
delivery's higher acceptance raises the drift at every depth, which is why only the constants needed
the tuning.

**Measured** (Q8_0 27B x 2-card tensor, f16 KV, `-n 3000`): code ceiling-12 **96.0** vs ceiling-7
**95.8** (was 92.8 vs 96.3), 4 depth changes instead of 40; reasoning 60.8 vs 57.9 fixed-3 (+5.0 %),
prose 81.2 vs 73.0 (+11.2 %), code 96.0 vs 80.8 (+18.8 %), recall 137.3 vs 86.5 (+58.7 %, mean depth
10.6 riding at the ceiling).  On the 1-card UD-Q4_K_XL reference code ceiling-12 is **84.7** vs
ceiling-7 61.4 (+37.9 %), reasoning -0.8 %, prose +0.4 %.  Greedy output is purity-neutral:
adaptive cap 7 == adaptive cap 12 == fixed `draft-mtp` (byte-identical text).  Record:
`benchmarks/2026-09-15-adaptive-mtp-tuning.md`.

**New gate prompt.**  `prompts/code-reasoning-mixed.txt` (sha256 `97a4caa7...`) -- ten tasks that each
ask for prose reasoning *then* a snippet, so the stream alternates code <-> reasoning.  It is maximal
at the floor (64.3 t/s at depth 3, falling monotonically to 50.0 at depth 12), so it is the prompt
that punishes a controller slow to drop after a code phase; the tuned controller reads **64.0**
against its 64.3 pinned-depth optimum.  A near-ratchet tuning that won pure code
(`drop max(120, 30d)` = 94.7) lost 2 % here and was rejected.

**Residual.**  An unexplained ~2 % gap between an adaptive run and a *pinned* run at the same mean
depth (per-round wall time; the transitions themselves cost only +1.0 ms/change).  Maintainer
hypothesis: graph invalidation on the depth change.  `cap - 3` and the constants are tuned on the
reporter's cell and should be re-tuned per shape (the `SPC_*` env knobs used for the sweep are WIP
only and are not in the delivery).

## 2026-09-15 (re-base) — `v16-d1d3c3396-r1`: re-based onto upstream master `d1d3c3396`

**Release.** `v16-d1d3c3396-r1`, fork point `d1d3c3396` (`ci: build MUSA for only 1 arch (#28944)`,
tree `3ce99b5422bf022de24341606a9984e2c90d627b`), canonical 16-block tip
`af9ce375ded5238b59598290ad7366760b7dc6e0`, tree `c6896785a5fefdf9438d26974c0274bf99f43263`.
`scripts/validate-set.sh` passes strict 16/16 (`git am`, applied tree == recorded tree); the set
applies whitespace-clean. The previous delivery was `v16-790cf51aa-r5` (tip `6f76c1cb1`, tree
`d735d6c11`).

**Why.** The working `~/llama.cpp` checkout was pulled to a fresh upstream master tip — 51 upstream
commits past `790cf51aa`. The 16 block commits were replayed with
`git rebase --onto d1d3c3396 790cf51aa 6f76c1cb` in a scratch worktree; the re-base is the sanctioned
"rebuild at the fork point" (the delivery is the patches, not the fork branch).

**Conflicts (3 files) and how they were resolved.**

- **block 00 × `fc82583e6 vulkan: support sparse Flash Attention (#28105)`** — both sides rewrote the
  V-staging path of `flash_attn_cm1.comp`. Upstream introduced the sparse indexer (`fa_kv_index()`,
  `USE_SPARSE`, and the `stage_k/stage_v` forced-staging arms); block 00 carried the gfx1151
  masked-V/freed-cell fix (the `col_live` per-column liveness + `tile_has_dead`). The merge keeps
  **both**: `stage_v = USE_DECODE_V || KV_bounds_check || USE_SPARSE || tile_has_dead`, and every
  staging condition is `kv_active && col_live[...] && …`. The non-sparse arm keeps upstream's exact
  `(!KV_bounds_check || (v_row < KV && v_col < HSV))` semantics (the naive simplification would have
  changed the out-of-range padding column read); `flash_attn.comp` auto-merged (upstream's
  `fa_kv_index` skip composes with block 00's `any_live`/`any_mask` skip).
- **block 03 × `1e7bcf3da`/`4a8993735` FA test matrix (`tests/test-backend-ops.cpp`)** — upstream added
  the `hsk == 96` MiniCPM3 arm/filter, block 03 added the `112` head size to both sweep lists. Merged:
  both lists carry `96, 112` and both filters (`hsk != 96 && …` and `hsk == 96 && hsv != 64 && hsv != 96`)
  are kept.
- **block 14 × `41abbfd59 qwen4exp: enable rms_norm + mul fusion (#28896)`** — upstream now stores the
  grouped-norm gammas as `{n_embd, hc}` (with `TENSOR_ALLOW_RESHAPE`) and multiplies the stream-3d
  tensor *before* the `hc_dim` reshape (`ggml_mul(ggml_rms_norm(x), w)`), in both `build_hc_mix` and
  PLE's `grouped_norm`. Our block-14 flags (`trunk_flags`/`flags`) were folded into the new shapes
  (`{n_embd, hc}, TENSOR_ALLOW_RESHAPE | flags`), and the fused `ggml_hc_mix` op's three
  `w_norm->ne[0] == hc_dim` asserts became `ggml_nelements(w_norm) == hc_dim` (the layouts are
  byte-identical). **One latent crash this exposed was found by validation and fixed:** the MTP head's
  own `layer.nextn.hc_head_norm` (a block-14 tensor upstream does not have) was still loaded
  `{hc_dim}`, so the reservation-only (`nt == 0`) unfused `build_hc_mix` chain hit
  `GGML_ASSERT(ggml_can_repeat(b, a))` in `ggml_mul` on every qwen4exp `--spec-type draft-mtp` load.
  It now loads `{n_embd, hc}, TENSOR_ALLOW_RESHAPE | flags` too; the MTP head's `nextn.hnorm` keeps its
  `{hc_dim}` shape (it uses block-14's own reshape-before-mul path, not the upstream one).

**Notable auto-merges (no textual conflict, verified by the gates).** `ggml-cuda.cu` (upstream's
row-contiguous `SUM_ROWS`/`MEAN` support predicate and `DUP` relaxations), `reduce_rows.cuh`'s
strided refactor (block 08's `topk_moe` implements its own reduction order — it does not call the
kernel), `common_context_can_seq_rm`'s `llama_n_rs_seq` reorder, `models.h`/`llama-arch.*`/`llama-model.cpp`
(MAPLE added alongside our qwen4exp), and the `fattn-mma-f16.cuh` MFMA fp32-accumulation split
(upstream now has separate `AMD_MFMA_AVAILABLE`/`AMD_WMMA_AVAILABLE` VKQ_C arms; our WMMA/RDNA work is
unaffected). **Nothing in the delivery was retired** — no upstream commit subsumes a delivery item
(upstream's `41abbfd59` is the generic-chain norm fold; our `ggml_hc_mix` is a wider kernel fusion and
stays).

**Validation (gfx1201, ROCm 7.14, 3× R9700).** Clean ROCm build (`~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714`)
exit 0. `test-backend-ops`: `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5951/5951**, `FLASH_ATTN_QSA`, `GATED_DELTA_NET`,
`TOPK_MOE`, `HC_MIX`, `HC_COMBINE` all pass. Greedy purity: dense 27B `--spec-type none` ==
`draft-mtp` byte-identical (`f23f5e77569907ef`, q8_0 KV, 1024 tokens, acceptance 0.5805); qwen4exp
(Flash-Next Q4_K_XL) plain == `draft-mtp` byte-identical on the wide/sparse prose prompt
(`608b7b3192e1`, 1231 chars), MTP acceptance 0.667. Gemma-4-E4B (SWA / kq-mask) generates coherently
at `-sm layer` and on 2-GPU `-sm tensor` (identical `5dd272b4f316`); the 3-GPU `-sm tensor` meta-splitter
abort (2 KV heads < 3 devices) is the documented pre-existing issue.

**Full `-n 3000` adaptive-MTP four-axis gate (gfx1201, 1× R9700).** Fixed `n3` acceptance 0.60 / 0.81 /
0.91 / 0.99 on R/P/C/K (all far above the ~0.45 floor); `n3` and adaptive `n12` are both well ahead of
plain on every axis; delivery `n3` is within 1.4 % of the stock-at-`d1d3c3396` `n3` on every axis (the
delivery's win is the deeper/adaptive drafts); **`plain == draft-mtp n3` is byte-identical on all four
axes** at the gate length, with the adaptive `n12` above-7 divergence confined to prose/code as
documented.  Table + stock reference: [`benchmarks/2026-09-15-rebase-v17-validation.md`](benchmarks/2026-09-15-rebase-v17-validation.md).

**gfx1151 (Strix Halo) pass.** The same patch set built and validated on the `halo` box (applied tree
`c6896785a`): custom ops pass, `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` 0 failures, 27B Q8_0 `plain == draft-mtp`
(`2bde6e01c95f`), qwen4exp `plain == draft-mtp` (`07219ff0c119`, acceptance 0.489), SWA Gemma-4-E4B
output `5dd272b4f316` identical to the gfx1201 build.  Prefill **+25-82 %** vs the stock base (27B Q8_0
q8_0 KV pp512 471 vs 367, pp512 @ d16k 394 vs 314; 35B-A3B Q4_K_M pp512 **1717 vs 946**), decode flat
to +1.5 %.  No gfx1151 regression.  Numbers: [`benchmarks/2026-09-15-rebase-v17-validation.md`](benchmarks/2026-09-15-rebase-v17-validation.md).

**Performance vs the stock build at the same fork point** (`llama-bench -r 2`, 3-GPU tensor; stock built
directly from `d1d3c3396`):

| model / KV | test | new | stock | delta |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 27B UD-Q4_K_XL, f16 | pp512 | 2064 | 1904 | +8.4 % |

| 27B UD-Q4_K_XL, f16 | pp512 @ d16384 | 1740 | 1569 | +10.9 % |

| Flash-Next Q4_K_XL, `-sm layer` | tg128 | 36.7 | 25.5 | +44 % |

The rule-5 verify-width gate (`llama-batched-bench -npp 16 -ntg 32 -npl 1,4,8`, 27B q8_0 KV) also
holds: B=1 35.76 vs 34.97 t/s, B=4 140.7 vs 86.9, **B=8 195.1 vs 120.1**. qwen4exp `-sm tensor`
(1181 pp / 50.8 tg) is a delivery-only configuration — stock upstream rejects tensor split for the
architecture and cannot even load the 103.68 GiB checkpoint without block 14's managed lazy reader /
PLE streaming.

**Follow-ups.** None opened by the re-base. The re-base is behaviour-changing only where upstream's own
changes are (qwen4exp norm fold, FA/MFMA and `SUM_ROWS` numerics); all delivery guarantees re-measured
above. The `TODO.md` Open list is unchanged.

## 2026-09-15 (latest) — GHCR containers (issue #33): ROCm >= 7.14 images could not find the ROCm runtime

**The report.**  Issue #33 ("No usable GPU found in container"): `ghcr.io/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts:latest`
started with `warning: no usable GPU found ... compiled without GPU support`, and `ldd libggml-hip.so`
showed every ROCm dependency unresolved (`librccl.so.1`, `libhipblas.so.3`, `librocblas.so.5`,
`libamdhip64.so.7` → `not found`).  The same `ldd` in upstream's `server-rocm` (ROCm 7.2.1) resolved
them to `/opt/rocm-7.2.1/lib/...`, which is why the comparison looked like a build defect.

**The cause (build system, not the patch set).**  The ROCm `>= 7.14` `-full` dev images install the
runtime under `/opt/rocm/core-<ver>/lib` (exposed as `/opt/rocm/lib` through the alternatives links) but
**do not register that path with the dynamic loader**: `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/` has only the OpenCL entry and
the images set no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (`ldconfig -p | grep rocm` = 0).  The built `libggml-hip.so` carries
only the useless build-tree `RUNPATH=/app/build/bin`, so the backend dlopen fails and llama.cpp falls back
to "compiled without GPU support".  The `<= 7.2` `-complete` images still register `/opt/rocm-<ver>/lib`
via ldconfig (81 cache entries) — that is the upstream-image case that works, and it is why only the
`full`-based lines broke.

**The fix.**  `.devops/rdna-rocm.Dockerfile`: `ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/rocm/lib` in the `base` stage
(inherited by `full`/`light`/`server`); harmless on the 7.2 line, which already resolves via ldconfig.
`/opt/rocm/lib` is safe to put first — it holds no system sonames (the sysdeps are isolated under
`/opt/rocm/lib/rocm_sysdeps/lib`, which is deliberately *not* added, its libs resolve via `$ORIGIN`).
Same change also drops the stale `MrDrMcCoy` URLs from the image labels (now `stew675`) and from
`CONTAINERS.md`; the workflow already pushed to `ghcr.io/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER}/...`.

**Verified on gfx1201.**  Reproduced on the published `latest` and `server-rocm-7.14`
(`llama-server --list-devices` → `Available devices: (none)`); with the env baked in (built as a one-line
layer on top of each image) the dependencies resolve and it lists `ROCm0..2: AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700
(gfx1201)` plus `ROCm3: gfx1036`.  `server-rocm-7.2` was already correct.  No patch/`release.json` change;
the already-published 7.14/10.0 tags need a rebuild (weekly schedule or the next `v*` tag) to carry it.

## 2026-09-15 (later) — `v16-790cf51aa-r5`: build time — a clean backend build was gated by one translation unit

**Release.**  `v16-790cf51aa-r5`, tip `6f76c1cb1d80c7ecbf176f939a351bc385ff33fc`, tree
`d735d6c11258ae939cfd392511e3f29ac22a7686`; block 15 amended again (message + one file), 16 patches +
`rdna-boosts-all.patch` + `release.json` regenerated, `scripts/validate-set.sh` passes strict 16/16.

**The report.**  A fresh ROCm build had become slow, and a single TU (`fattn-tile.cu`) took over 4
minutes to compile on a 16-core machine.

**The cause (ours).**  Block 03 turned `type_KV` into a template parameter of
`ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_tile_case` (BF16, then the quantized arms), while
`DECL_FATTN_TILE_CASE`/`EXTERN_DECL_FATTN_TILE_CASES` kept covering only F16/BF16 — the upstream
mechanism splits the *head-size* axis over 12 generated `template-instances/fattn-tile-instance-*.cu`
files and externs it in the dispatch, and the type axis was never added to it.  The dispatch has an
unconditional `case` per native type, so the other six types were instantiated **implicitly in the
dispatch TU**: `nm -C fattn-tile.cu.o` defined **72 of its 96** `tile_case` symbols (12 head-size combos
x 6 quantized types, each with both softcap variants and the whole `ncols2` chain) while every generated
instance file defined just 2.  That one TU was **509 s of a 538 s** clean `-j16` backend build.

**The fix.**  The macros now expand per type (`DECL_FATTN_TILE_CASE_TYPE(DKQ, DV, T)` for F16, BF16,
q8_0, q4_0, q4_1, q5_0, q5_1, iq4_nl) — one file, `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn-tile.cuh`, +31/-8, no
runtime effect.  The generated files carry 8 cases each and the dispatch TU holds only externs (96 `U`).

**Measured.**  Clean `ggml-hip`, `-j16`, 16 cores (gfx1201): **538 s -> 330 s**; `fattn-tile.cu` **509 s
-> < 10 s**; the new critical path is the `fattn-mma-f16` instance set at ~250 s.  A **full fresh build**
with the maintainer's own script (`~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714`: `rm -rf build-rocm`, configure, every
target, `-j16`) is **362 s** on this box.

**The remaining half (diagnosed, deliberately not fixed here).**  The MMA instance TUs are ours too: the
native-KV arm chain instantiates the whole WMMA kernel once per KV type *inside every instance TU*, so
the same TU (`ncols1_4-ncols2_4`, 8 head-size cases in both) went **0.90 -> 7.26 MB** and **6.7 -> 229 s**
versus the base — ~1950 s of CPU across 21 TUs.  Fixing it means either a finer generated-file
granularity (~21 -> ~150 TUs, same total work, better packing) or a runtime KV-type dispatch in the WMMA
loader (one kernel copy, ~8x less code, one uniform branch in the tile load) — both are code-path
changes that need their own A/B, so they are parked in `TODO.md` rather than folded into this release.

**Verified zero runtime change.**  `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5951/5951, 0 failures**; 27B
prose text hashes **bit-identical** to the pre-amendment build (q8_0 `472b282950b5`, q4_0
`118eb7f5fe85`, f16 `70960317a203`); `tg64@32768`/`pp8192` within **0.12 %** of the recorded r4 values
across five KV types, with controls (q4_1 staged 23.18 vs the recorded 23.14; default `-r 3`
25.58 +- 0.13 vs 25.44) showing the sub-0.1 % first-pass offsets were single-sample noise.

**Also measured (not a delivery issue).**  The full backend build emits **10,362** `warning: loop not
unrolled ... [-Wpass-failed]` lines and every one is from `fattn-mma-f16.cuh` — the bare `#pragma unroll`
loops whose bounds are runtime values (dominantly the K/V staging loop at `421:13`, "no viable unroll
count found").  Those pragmas are upstream's and identical at the base; only the *count* is amplified by
our extra instantiations.  Warnings, not errors.

**Docs.**  `archive/work/build-time-regression/` (README + tools + the raw logs/timings),
`patches/README.md` (the two 2026-09-15 block-15 amendment sections), `AGENTS.md` (the new
"FA instantiation discipline" critical fact + the block-15 bullet + the canonical tip/tree),
`README.md`, `MANIFESTS.md`, `BASELINE.md`, `TODO.md` (the MMA follow-up).

## 2026-09-15 — `v16-790cf51aa-r4`: the reporter's q4_0 NaN, the prefill band split, and the last four native KV arms

**Release.**  `v16-790cf51aa-r4`, tip `b19c70b341f9ed439bcda2a636fe6e5fa4fa634b`, tree
`7fab975d9518b29aa7d890c1163f13a6c393c5df`; 16 patches + `rdna-boosts-all.patch` + `release.json`
regenerated, `scripts/validate-set.sh` **PASSED** (strict 16/16 `git am`, applied tree == the recorded
tree).  Amends **block 15** only.

**Why (issue #30's second round).**  @briansp2020 re-ran on r3 and reproduced every claim — and found a
regression the gates had missed: **4 NaN failures in `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT`** with a
`q4_0` K/V.  Chasing them surfaced a second bug and two open items, all now closed.

**1. The NaN: the tile kernel's K/V type contract.**  The tile kernel is instantiated with ONE `type_KV`
for both operands (that is why it needs a single-type predicate) and builds its native operand
descriptors from that compile-time type; it ignores the launcher's runtime native-type arguments.
`launch_fattn` chose its native read **per tensor**, so a mixed pair (K=q4_0/V=f16, K=q4_0/V=q8_0,
K=f16/V=q4_0, K=q8_0/V=q4_0) fell back to the `F16` tile with the native operand's staging **skipped**,
and the kernel read raw q4_0 bytes as F16.  `launch_fattn` now takes the kernel's native type explicitly
(`kv_native_kernel`; tile = its `type_KV`, vec = `NONE`, MMA = per-operand).  Unreachable from a normal
run (llama.cpp hard-rejects mixed caches) — only the op test could see it.

**2. The second bug: the q4_0 arm's memory win was never delivered.**
`ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_get_alloc_size`'s TILE case learned the q8_0 arm but not the q4_0 one, so a
q4_0 cache reserved the F16 scratch the launcher no longer used: `-c 196608` q4_0 **849.04 -> 123.04
MiB**.  The case now mirrors `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_tile_case_type`.

**3. The prefill band split + the arena + the arch gate (TODO item 21, CLOSED).**  Native staging removed
the whole-cache F16 pass (a decode win at depth) but paid a per-tile dequant at prefill.  A prefill
(`n_q > 8`) now stages and decode/verify (`n_q <= 8`) reads natively.  The scratch moved out of the
compute-graph reserve into a per-context, per-stream arena, because the reserve graph's `K->ne[1]` is
`n_ctx` — that is the ~726 MiB the adaptive-MTP `-c 196608` load was short of.  Safe because a
multi-token graph is never CUDA-graph captured.  gfx1201 q8_0 `pp150000` **691.4/1076.9/1199.0**
(1/2/3 GPU, from 661.0/996.0/1111.4), decode and the 123 MiB reserve unchanged.  Arch-gated: gfx1151
measures the native prefill faster at *every* depth, so `prefill_stages = !GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3_5(cc)`.

**4. Native arms for `q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1`/`iq4_nl` (TODO item 2, CLOSED).**  The four chunk dequantizers +
the plumbing, closing the last gap in the V4 set.  The 2026-09-14 WIP failed the op test 4703/5951; two
real bugs hid behind that one symptom: the **tile loader's native branch was a hand-written
`type_KV == Q8_0 || Q4_0` test** (so the new instantiations took the F16 branch and read a staging buffer
`need_f16_K == false` had left unwritten — the `hsk=72` NaNs), and the **q5_0/q5_1 chunk helpers took the
low nibble in both halves** (the `lo ? ... : b0 >> 4` test was missing).  A third "fix" — using `qh` bit
`e-4` for the upper half — was wrong and reverted: the reference's `xh_1 = (qh >> (j + 12)) & 0x10` masks
bit 4 of the *shifted* value, i.e. `qh` bit `j + 16`, so the 5th bit is the element index in both halves
(settled by a host test against `dequantize_row_q5_0`).  Gains: tg64 @ d32768 staged -> default gfx1201
+9.9/+10.8/+12.5/+8.8 %, gfx1151 +22.9/+26.0/+26.7/+22.0 % for a 0.6-1.1 % prefill cost.

**Gates.**  `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5951/5951 on gfx1201 and gfx1151**; same-seed greedy
text `native == staging` **identical for all eight KV types on both**; `W=1..8` one logits hash per type
(all eight PURE on gfx1151; gfx1201 pure except the pre-existing q4_0 band edges).

**Doctrine update (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §36).**  The per-quant purity grid was re-measured across all eight
types and five prefill lengths on gfx1201.  It shows the guarantee must be stated **at the level it
holds**: the *text/acceptance* contract (`plain == draft-mtp`, MTP acceptance, one greedy text) is what
the delivery guarantees for f16/bf16/q8_0, while *logits-level* `W=1..8` purity is a **measurement** —
bf16 has one recorded edge (P=200 on the 4B).  Every observed edge is logits-level with the **argmax
unchanged** and the top-2 margin at 2.2+ (bf16 delta 0.014, q4_1 delta 0.064), and all are pre-existing
(reproduced byte-identically with `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE=0`).

**Docs.**  `../AGENTS.md` (the KV-purity critical-facts bullet), `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §36, `TODO.md`
(items 2 and 21 -> Closed), `patches/README.md` (the 2026-09-15 block-15 amendment section),
`archive/work/issue-30-mtp-decode-regression/MEASUREMENTS.md` §F-H + §I.

**Also 2026-09-15 — the `W=1` vs `W>=2` logits edge: investigated, documented, WON'T FIX.**  §36 had
described a residual `n_q = 1` vs `n_q >= 2` difference and attributed it to the `n_q = 1` launch running
the tile's whole `cols_per_block`.  A launcher dump (`tools/fattn-launch-dump.patch`, `GGML_CUDA_FA_DEBUG2`)
**withdrew that explanation**: the KV split is already width-invariant (`parallel_blocks=8` at `n_q=1/2/4`;
block 00's `ntiles_dst_eff` fix covers the band, `stream_k=0` on the tile path) and `ncols1=1` means there
are no phantom query columns at all.  What remains is a rounding edge inside the FA path — `argmax`
identical in every observed case, delta 0.014-0.064 logits against a top-2 margin of 2.2-2.7, MTP
acceptance bit-identical across arms, and one to two orders of magnitude below the error the coarse KV
quantization itself imposes.  Leading (unproven) candidate: the per-tile mask-derived `i_sup` bound.
Decision: don't chase it — the fix would make every width process the same KV range, taxing the
single-token decode for no measurable reward, and it is the same recurring 0.5-9 % retrofit class as §19.
**Revisit only on an `argmax` change**; re-run the 8-type x 5-length grid (~20 min) whenever a
single-token-tuned kernel changes.  Detail: `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §36 (withdrawn claim marked in place),
`MEASUREMENTS.md` §J, `TODO.md` Closed.

## 2026-09-14 (later) — block-04 amendment: RDNA prefill tuning, now arch- and split-aware

**Why.**  Issue #30's reconciliation left one open finding: the delivery's prefill fell off faster with
depth than stock (`llama-bench -p 150000`, 1 GPU, 27B UD-Q4_K_XL, f16: delivery 609.5 vs stock 686.9;
KV-type-independent, so not q8_0).  Fitting `t = a + b*n` over pp4K..64K showed the delivery's `a`
smaller (the low-depth wins) but its depth slope `b` ~51 % larger (5.73e-9 vs 3.79e-9) — a
per-(query x KV)-cell attention cost.

**Root cause — two FA-config issues.**
* The head-256 `ncols=64` entry in `ggml_cuda_fattn_mma_get_config_rdna` was a **Strix Halo (gfx1151)
  "halo row"** (`nthreads 256, occupancy 1, nbatch_fa 32, nbatch_V2 64, Q_in_reg=false`).  With gqa 6 the
  launcher picks `ncols1 = 64/ncols2 = 8` for every `n_q > 8`, so **all** prefill/wide-verify attention
  used it; that half-tile/Q-out-of-registers shape is ~1.5x per attention cell on RDNA4/RDNA3_0.
* The delivery omitted upstream #28102's AMD `switch_ncols2` block ("minimize wasted compute"), so for
  gqa 6 it picked `ncols2 = 8` (2 of 8 GQA lanes wasted) where stock picks `ncols2 = 2`.

**Change (block 04).**
* The RDNA config is `cc`-aware: `is_rdna3_5` keeps the halo row (it was tuned there), RDNA4/RDNA3_0 take
  upstream's `(256, 2, 64, 128, 128, 64, 1, true)`.  `RDNA3_5`/`RDNA4` are per-gfx in `vendors/hip.h`, so
  the host dispatch uses `GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3_5(cc)` and the device constexpr uses the macro.
* `ncols2` is **split-aware**: a new frontend hint `ggml_set_fa_tensor_parallel` (ggml.h/ggml.c), set once
  in the `llama_context` constructor from `split_mode() == LLAMA_SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR && n_cuda_dev > 1`
  (`n_devices()` is 1 under tensor split because the meta device wraps the GPUs, so it counts CUDA
  sub-devices via `ggml_backend_dev_is_cuda`).  The chooser uses generic `ncols2=8` for tensor parallel,
  stock's AMD `ncols2=2` for a whole card.

**Measured (27B UD-Q4_K_XL, f16, `pp150000`; stock 686.9 single / 1111.8 tensor).**

| mode | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| 1 GPU | 609.5 | **703.4 (+2.4 %)** |
| 2-GPU tensor | — | **1087.5 (+6.9 %)** |
| 3-GPU tensor | — | **1218.6 (+9.6 %)** |

`pp64K` single 876.1 -> 946.8.  q8_0 KV prefill is at parity with stock (−1.2 / −0.2 / +2.4 % across
1/2/3 cards); its 4-8 % gap to f16 is the V4 native-staging prefill cost, filed as TODO item 21.  Purity
held: the 4B q4_0 `W = 1..8` band is one hash.

**Verification.**  Block 04 amended in place (blocks 05-15 replayed; two `ggml.h` conflicts resolved by
keeping both declaration sets).  Patches regenerated (16), `rdna-boosts-all.patch` re-cut, `release.json`
-> **`v16-790cf51aa-r3`** (tip `a2c8d06a7`, tree `eb5b7583`).  `scripts/validate-set.sh` PASSES (strict
16/16 `git am` on a fresh `790cf51aa` tarball).  Testing lesson: **`-sm tensor` masked the single-card
regression** — screen with the slope fit at pp8-48K and always measure 1 GPU too.

## 2026-09-14 — block-15 amendment: V4 native staging is the default for sub-F16 KV quants + the q4_0 native arm (issue #30)

**Why.**  Issue #30's reconciliation (`archive/work/issue-30-mtp-decode-regression/`) isolated a real
delivery-specific regression: with a **quantized** K/V cache the delivery's decode falls off faster with
context depth than stock.  Measured on 1 GPU (27B UD-Q4_K_XL, `tg64`, `-fa auto`): the delivery q8_0
retained 66.1 % of its d0 rate at d65536 vs stock's 80.1 % (18.92 vs 22.43 t/s), q4_0 68.9 % vs 75.9 %
(19.72 vs 21.03).  The delivery's BF16 path was fine and ahead of stock's f16 at every depth (the block-03
predicate); only the quantized types diverged.

**Root cause.**  Block 08's F1 fix (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §14) deleted the VEC fallback upstream uses for a
quantized K/V at small `n_q`, so the whole delivery band takes the **tile** kernel — which for a
quantized cache is preceded by a **whole-cache F16 staging pass** (`need_f16_K/V = 1`).  That pass is
proportional to `n_kv` and runs on every decode step, so its cost grows with depth.  The block-15 `V4`
native-staging arm removes it but was **opt-in** (`GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE=1`), and q4_0 had no arm at
all.

**Change (block 15, one amendment).**

* `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE` becomes a **three-state policy**: unset = **auto** (native q8_0/q4_0 **on**,
native bf16 off), `=1` forces all on, `=0` forces the pre-amendment F16-staging path (the escape
hatch).  The F16-staging pass is the cost for the sub-F16 quants; bf16 already has a native tile/vec
path, so its MMA-scratch arm (V5) stays opt-in.
* A **native q4_0 arm** (`ggml_cuda_fattn_dequantize_q4_0_chunk`, arithmetic-identical to `convert.cu`'s
`dequantize_block_q4_0`) beside the q8_0/bf16 ones, wired through the tile and MMA loaders
(`FATTN_KV_NATIVE_Q4_0`, the predicates, `flash_attn_tile_load_tile_native` /
`flash_attn_ext_f16_load_tile_native`).

**Measured (1 GPU, gfx1201, 27B UD-Q4_K_XL).**  q8_0 d65536 18.92 -> **23.29** (+23 %, stock 22.43) and
q4_0 19.72 -> **22.82** (+16 %, stock 21.03), for ~1.2-1.3 % prefill.  Numerics are unchanged: same-seed
greedy text native == staging (q8_0 `ab94eb7db4d4`, q4_0 `edafcdc7f8df`), `W=1..8` is one logits hash for
every supported type, and MTP `n_max 3` acceptance is unchanged (0.75182).

**Side effect — adaptive MTP at high context loads again.**  The `--spec-draft-n-max 12 -c 196608
-ctk/ctv q8_0` load failure (reported in issue #30) was the **same root cause**: the ~744 MiB/GPU F16
staging scratch was exactly the 260 MiB the MTP draft context was short.  With the new default the exact
config loads at the default `n_slots = 4` and generates (34.76 t/s, acceptance 0.3404);
`GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE=0` reproduces the failure.  The deeper recurrent-state snapshot budget and its
levers (including an opt-in f32 -> bf16 snapshot trade to be measured) are filed in
`archive/work/issue-30-mtp-decode-regression/RECURRENT-SNAPSHOT-BUDGET.md`.

**Action E (#28867 head-256 WMMA threshold) — investigated, no delivery change.**  The reporter's ~20 %
regression is upstream-master-specific: the delivery's `Q->ne[1] > 8` guard already keeps the whole
purity band (`W <= 8`, his repro range) on TILE, and for `n_q = 9..N` the tuned block-04 head-256 WMMA
configs are at parity with TILE (recall `n_max 8` 115.10 vs 115.72 t/s, `n_max 15` 147.19 vs 147.80 t/s,
acceptance bit-identical).  Adopting the MFMA threshold 64 is a ~0.4 % neutral selection change, not a
purity change; left out.

**Canonical chain / verification.**  Block 15 amended in place (`b36517087` -> `9ee71c356`), net tree
`58317e0d64dd01a3622ba90b159ae12d1619c835`; `patches/` regenerated (16 patches) and
`rdna-boosts-all.patch` re-cut.  `scripts/validate-set.sh` PASSES against a fresh `790cf51aa` tarball:
checksums OK, base tree == `97726d3760…`, strict **16/16** `git am`, applied tree == `58317e0d…`.
Release `release.json` bumped to **`v16-790cf51aa-r2`**.

**Follow-ups filed.**  TODO item 2 (native arms for `q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1`/`iq4_nl`; they track stock but
sit ~12-16 % behind f16 at d32k) and item 20 (the issue-#30 umbrella: the recurrent-snapshot budget/levers
and the f32 -> bf16 opt-in measurement).

## 2026-09-13 (latest) — release infrastructure: tag-driven CI, `release.json` as single source of truth, first tagged release `v16-790cf51aa`

**Why.**  The GHCR container workflow failed on every push to `main`.  The run failed *before*
Docker, in all three matrix jobs, at `git am`:

```
error: patch failed: common/speculative.cpp:1621
error: common/speculative.cpp: patch does not apply
...
error: sha1 information is lacking or useless (common/arg.cpp).
error: could not build fake ancestor
```

Two independent bugs.  **(1) A stale fork point:** the workflow pinned `FORK_POINT: 9113cc188`, but the
delivery had been re-based onto `790cf51aa` the same day; the `git am -3` fallback could never rescue
it, because a fresh `git init` over a codeload tarball has none of the preimage blobs named in the
patches' `index` lines.  **(2) The tarball recipe dropped tracked files:** `git add -A` honours
`.gitignore`, so three upstream-tracked files (`build-xcframework.sh` via `/build*`,
`benches/dgx-spark/run-aime-120b-t8-x8-high.log` via `*.log`, and an Xcode `xcshareddata` plist) were
dropped and the reconstructed base tree was `b19ff2b596…` instead of the canonical
`97726d37607304e0215f19aee6af7fd33d1e65d4`.  `git add -A -f` restores the exact tree.

**Redesign (delivery infrastructure, no `patches/` content change).**

- **`release.json` is now the single source of truth** — fork point, canonical base tree, canonical
  tip/tree, block count, and the sha256 of every artifact.  `apply-all.sh`, `validate-set.sh` and both
  workflows read it, so the fork point can no longer drift in one place while another stays stale.
- **`scripts/make-release.sh`** regenerates it (patch hashes are derived; the metadata is inherited
  unless `--base`/`--base-tree`/`--tip`/`--tree` are passed on a re-base).
- **`scripts/validate-set.sh`** is the cheap gate (~1 min, no compiler/Docker): artifact checksums +
  strict `git am` on a fresh tarball of `release.json.base` + base-tree and applied-tree equality.
- **`.github/workflows/validate.yml`** (new) runs that gate on every push/PR.
- **`.github/workflows/docker-ghcr.yml`** is now **tag-driven**: `push.tags: ["v*"]`, manual dispatch and
  the weekly schedule.  The `push: branches: [main]` trigger — the "spawn nine image builds per docs
  commit" behaviour — is **removed**.  The base is read from `release.json`, each build asserts the
  reconstructed tree equals `release.json.tree`, and a `release` job (only on a tag) creates the GitHub
  Release with `rdna-boosts-all.patch`, `patches.tar.gz`, `release.json` and `SHA256SUMS`.
- **`scripts/apply-all.sh`** asserts the applied tree == `release.json.tree` on the strict path (so a
  stale fork point fails immediately, even outside CI).  `actions/checkout` bumped v4 -> v5.
- Docs: `CONTAINERS.md` (release process), `README.md` (#Releases), `AGENTS.md` layout table.

**First release.**  `release.json` now records `release: v16-790cf51aa`, `base: 790cf51aa`,
`base_tree: 97726d37607304e0215f19aee6af7fd33d1e65d4`, `tip: c45244c728dfcbcad86ae95aa97ae76f94ee9f7f`,
`tree: a5683e1b008e3ad197ac2a9e3f99e5b0652df7d4`, `n_blocks: 16`.  Annotated tag **`v16-790cf51aa`**
created on the commit carrying this manifest; the tag push runs the container matrix and cuts the
GitHub Release.

**Clean-apply / verification.**  `scripts/validate-set.sh` PASSES locally against a fresh
`790cf51aa` codeload tarball: checksums OK, base tree == `97726d3760…`, strict 16/16 `git am`, applied
tree == `a5683e1b008e…`.  This is the exact CI step reproduced outside CI.

## 2026-09-13 — issue #30 clamp policy: `--spec-draft-n-max` is raised from 7 to 15 (block 01) + the QSA decode-arm band fix (block 14)

**Mission (issue #30 follow-up).**  The `--spec-draft-n-max` clamp had to be re-decided: the maintainer
wants depth 15, and the park reason was a claim that depth > 7 allows **rewind-induced recurrent (chunked
GDN) corruption** on qwen4exp.  The rule the session was given: no rewind corruption at any allowed
depth; purity above 7 may be traded with a prominent warning; preferred end state 15 everywhere;
fallback 7 for QSA models only.  Result: **there is no rewind corruption, the clamp is now 15 with a
purity notice above 7, and the reported qwen4exp depth-15 divergence past the 2051 selection width was
a QSA decode-arm band flip, now fixed.**

**Canonical chain amended in place** (block 01 `10a7c331d` -> `38fc37c5e`, block 14 `378c9a9d6` ->
`55c733d5c`, block 15 replayed; new tip **`c45244c728dfcbcad86ae95aa97ae76f94ee9f7f`**, net tree
**`a5683e1b008e3ad197ac2a9e3f99e5b0652df7d4`**).  `patches/` regenerated; a fresh `790cf51aa` worktree +
`apply-all.sh` applies **strict 16/16 `git am`**, zero whitespace warnings, produced tree == canonical.
`make-patches.sh` default tip updated; `rdna-boosts-all.patch` regenerated (`sha256
39eab5fa917ea28ad2e43a5925fb5cb03481a27951435b245281c20f3fb19056`).

**1. No rewind corruption at depth 15 — `test-recurrent-state-depth` (new, block 01).**  A deterministic
sweep over the recurrent snapshot machinery: for every `n_rs_seq` 1..15, decode the full verify-shaped
batch, partial-rollback `r` tokens through the snapshot path, replay them, and compare the replayed
logits against a *reference context that never decoded past the rollback point* (bitwise, `eps=1e-5`).
Phase A is the verify shape (`n_tokens = K = n_rs_seq+1`, every `rollback` 1..`n_rs_seq`); Phase B is a
deep draft (`n_tokens = n_rs_batch > K`, which is what `n_rs_batch` exists for).  **All green** on
`qwen35-dense` / `qwen4exp-moe` / `deepseek4-moe` / `kimi-k3-moe` (the generated dummy models), i.e. the
band the delivery allows covers the snapshot set exactly.  The gate is registered as
`test-recurrent-state-depth` + `test-recurrent-state-depth-qwen4exp` in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`.

**2. The qwen4exp depth-15 divergence was the QSA decode arm, not the recurrent state (block 14).**  A
real-model decode/verify width matrix (3x R9700 `-sm tensor`, `P=2500 > width = indexer_top_k + r - 1 =
2051`, f16 KV, token-0 logits) shows the pre-fix behaviour: **W = 1..8 one hash, W = 9..16 another** and
the upper group == the forced-sparse hash — `QSA_DECODE_BAND = 8` gated the dense decode arm
`n_tokens <= 8`, so a depth-8..15 verify batch fell through to the approximate sparse top-k selection
while the W=1 decode stayed dense.  That is the same class as the block-14 cause-2/cause-3 amendments,
re-opened for the built-in draft widths (it only manifests once `n_kv` passes the 2051 selection width —
the "triggers after ~2051 tokens" report).  The arm band is now
`max(QSA_DECODE_BAND, cparams.n_rs_batch)` (`cparams.n_rs_batch` = the longest enabled draft + 1, the
verify-width bound), so the whole verify band takes the same arm as the W=1 decode; the prefill arm is
made disjoint on the same effective band.  Default configs are unaffected (`n_max 3` -> `n_rs_batch 4` ->
band 8; `n_max 7` -> 8), so every recorded reference hash still holds.

Measured (real qwen4exp IQ4_XS, 3-GPU tensor, f16, `P=2500`, `RS=15`): pre-fix W=1..8 `643a8166d8dad677`
/ W=9..16 `1354757f9daf03db` (sparse); post-fix W=1..8 `643a8166d8dad677` / W=9..16 `05be2f7f30dbc426`
(dense).  The dummy `qwen4exp-moe` is now pure W=1..16 for **all eight native KV types** (f16/bf16/q4_0/
q4_1/q5_0/q5_1 `5009c55bca5e01ca`, q8_0 `3d51c0592b7cf913`, iq4_nl `bc19354924bcfb84`); pre-fix
it split `5009c55bca5e01ca` (W<=8) vs `596ec8bf7461da1a` (W>8).

**3. Purity above 7 is lost to the kernel families, not to a defect (the accepted trade).**  On the
real models W=1..8 and W=9..16 never agree even with QSA and FA off (27B UD-Q4_K_XL, f16, `P=2500`:
`8ef5ce3ab2d942dd` vs `7d1e01e82be4ce6b`; with `FA=0` `b5d4df87caa0348e` vs `0c0cb329b59aedc9`, and
qwen4exp with `LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1` likewise), because a verify wider than 8 rows switches kernel family in
more than one place: the FA tile/MMA chooser (`Q->ne[1] > 8`) **and** the matmul family
(`ncols <= MMVQ_MAX_BATCH_SIZE`/`MMVF_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` = 8 uses the decode kernels, above it MMQ).  That
is a near-tie trade, not corruption — end to end the depth-15 output is coherent and only differs from
`plain`/`n_max 7` where a greedy near-tie flipped (27B code-replay 3000 tokens: `plain` == `n_max 7` =
`57776c25503d`; `n_max 15` = `269a445fe4e8`, both rc=0 and coherent; qwen4exp code-replay `n_max 7`
57.9 t/s vs `n_max 15` 40.9 t/s — depth 15 over-drafts on that prompt, it is not corrupt).

**4. The clamp is now 15 with a purity notice above 7 (block 01).**  `common/common.cpp` clamps `> 15`
to 15 (visible `E`-level notice, `LLAMA_SPEC_DRAFT_N_MAX_CLAMP=0` escape hatch) and prints a visible
notice for any depth `> 7` stating that `--spec-type none` and `draft-mtp` may no longer be bit-identical
(the output stays valid and coherent); `common/arg.cpp` help now says `max: 15`.  The old comment blamed
FA purity alone; the new one states the hierarchy — the 15 bound is the **recurrent rollback snapshot
bound** (`n_max + 1 = K <= 16`, the constant the K-independent chunked-GDN threshold was built around), and
purity above 7 is the accepted trade.  The default `--spec-draft-n-max` is still 3, so the clamp
relaxation changes nothing unless the user asks for it.

**5. Revalidation.**  `tests/test-recurrent-state-rollback` unchanged and PASS (qwen35-dense,
qwen4exp-moe); `test-recurrent-state-depth` PASS on four recurrent/hybrid dummy archs; the qwen4exp
`FLASH_ATTN_QSA` suite is a kernel-op suite (graph-arm change only) and is unaffected; the depth-15
same-seed outputs are coherent on both real models.  Docs updated: `patches/README.md` (the block-01
and block-14 amendment notes + the current-state header), `AGENTS.md` (the block-01 bullet + Critical
facts), `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §11/§19, `benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md`, `TODO.md`,
`MANIFESTS.md`/`BASELINE.md`/`README.md` headers.  The parked issue-#30 response is corrected (its
clamp description) and its revision bumped.

**6. Adaptive MTP is presented at its recommended ceiling 12, on realistic-length runs (same day).**
With the clamp gone, the adaptive-MTP four-axis table (`benchmarks/2026-09-13-adaptive-mtp-4-axis-n12.md`)
re-measures `--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive --spec-draft-n-max 12` (block 001's original recommendation)
instead of the clamp-limited 7.  **The first two cuts of that table were wrong and were re-measured the
same day, and the two mistakes are the point:**

* **Reasoning.**  They ran every axis with the model's default reasoning mode; Qwen3.8 emits a thinking
trace for the prose and code prompts, so those two columns measured *thinking*, not content (the code
prompt at `-n 256` never reached any Python).  Corrected with `--reasoning off` for P/C/K and
`--reasoning on` for R (the flag is part of the chat template).
* **Length.**  They used `-n 256`, which measures the drafter/controller warm-up, not the mode.  At
  `-n 256` the code axis at ceiling 12 read **-5 %** vs fixed `n3`; at `-n 3000` it is **+28 %**.  The
  controller's mean accepted length goes 4.32 -> 7.02 as it warms up.  A short spot test inverts the
  ranking.

**Final protocol and result** (27B UD-Q4_K_XL, 1 GPU, f16, `-n 3000`, reasoning pinned): plain ~28.5-28.9
t/s everywhere; fixed `n3` R 46.4 / 0.57781 / 2.73, P 55.9 / 0.79379 / 3.38, C 63.7 / 0.91663 / 3.75,
K 68.1 / 0.99200 / 3.98 (stock `n3` within ~2 % on every axis); **adaptive `n12` R 46.0 / 0.57632 / 2.74,
P 63.4 / 0.50654 / 5.10, C 81.8 / 0.57863 / 7.02, K 109.6 / 0.96320 / 8.95**.  So against fixed `n3` the
mode is reasoning -1 %, prose **+13 %**, code **+28.5 %**, recall **+61 %**; against the old ceiling 7
it is prose +26 %, code +35 %, recall +44 %.  Acceptance is *lower* than fixed `n3` (it drafts deeper and
rejects more) but throughput is higher -- acceptance alone is not the metric.  At the reporter's exact
`n8 + p-min 0.55` configuration the delivery is ahead on every axis at both `n7` and `n8` (+0.8 % to
+8.2 %).  Text purity at `-n 3000` (no `-lv 4`): fixed `n3` == plain on every axis; adaptive `n12` ==
plain on reasoning (`98d4e36a79fb`) and recall (`a87c4318b649`) and diverges on prose (`27f3f7d3f80c`
vs `7ec08bc22946`) and code (`48241ec079f6` vs `a2eceaad5743`) -- the documented above-7 kernel-family
trade, which only appears once the run is long enough to hit a near-tie (at `-n 256` all four matched).
Stock is not pure under the protocol.  Depth 12 is inside the hard 15 bound.

The **length and reasoning requirements are now recorded in `benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md`
(gate rule 0) and `prompts/README.md`**.  A short run is valid only as a correctness smoke test, never
as a performance verdict.

**Lesson.**  "Depth > 7 is unsupported" had been resting on one stated reason (FA purity) while the real
qwen4exp effect was a different band (the QSA arm).  The no-corruption result came from a deterministic
reference-context sweep, not from acceptance numbers: acceptance is not a correctness signal (a
self-consistent corrupted pair can accept *more*), and over-drafting at depth 15 looks like a drop too.

## 2026-09-13 (latest) — block-14 amendment (ninth): the re-base's `ncols_opt` broke the pair fusion (dense prefill −14-48 %)

**Canonical chain amended in place** (block 14 `20bf37962` -> `378c9a9d6`, block 15 replayed; new tip
**`f27dc6d8006188d00ff96dadab6eb0edf79e2b7c`**, net tree
**`bbbe005e95381301fdc71e5d636f448bab147a65`**).  `patches/` regenerated; a fresh `790cf51aa` worktree +
`apply-all.sh` applies **strict 16/16 `git am`**, zero whitespace warnings, tree == canonical.
`make-patches.sh` default tip updated; the net patch regenerated.

**The bug.**  The 2026-09-13 re-base merged upstream `d4abd573f`, which added `ncols_opt` to `mmq_args`
(the tile heuristic optimises `ntiles_x = ceil(ncols_opt/J)` and stops at the first `J` that covers the
row).  The standalone MMQ path passes it, but block-14's `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q_pair` builds its
`mmq_args` by hand in **both** arms and still stopped one initialiser short, so the field defaulted to
`0` and every `J` gave `ntiles_x == 0` - the loop kept the first candidate, `J = 8`, the narrowest and
slowest tile.  Dense FFN gate+up pairs want `J = 64..128`, so the fusion was up to **2.2x slower than
not fusing**.  Invisible on the qwen4exp `MUL_MAT_ID` pair it was written for (each expert sees few
tokens, correct `J` ~8), and the pair A/B had only ever been run on qwen4exp.

**The fix.**  `mmq.cu`: both pair arms set `ncols_opt` like the standalone (dense: `dst->ne[1]`;
`MUL_MAT_ID`: the RDNA per-expert average `(ne12*n_expert_used + ne02 - 1)/ne02`).  `mmq.cuh`: the
heuristic falls back to `ncols_max` when `ncols_opt <= 0`, so a caller that predates the field can
never silently pick the worst tile again.

**Measured** (`llama-bench`, f16 KV, pp4096, `-r 2`, 3x R9700; pre-rebase = the archived tip
`907799de3` @ `9113cc188` rebuilt in a worktree, buggy = the pre-fix rebased tip `6303f0489`):

| model / config | pre-rebase | rebased (buggy) | **rebased + fix** | stock `790cf51aa` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 27B Q8_0, 1 GPU | 1348.3 | 623.0 | **1363.2** | 1203.2 |
| 27B Q8_0, `-sm tensor` | 2147.7 | 1717.6 | **2175.5** | 2001.7 |
| 27B UD-Q4_K_XL, 1 GPU | 1262.1 | 904.6 | **1264.0** | 1094.1 |
| 27B UD-Q4_K_XL, `-sm tensor` | 2016.4 | 1692.7 | **2039.9** | 1839.3 |
| 4B Q8_0, 1 GPU | 7127.9 | 5386.1 | **7303.6** | 5807.5 |

Numerics unchanged: the fused pair is byte-identical to the unfused path (27B same-seed
`d03d0bc727a8` with and without `GGML_PAIR_DENSE_OFF=1`); only the tile width changes.  qwen4exp is
unaffected (controlled pre-rebase A/B, `-b 2048 -ub 2048`, tensor, pp8192: f16 sparse 2405.3 ->
**2435.9**, f16 dense 2586.8 -> **2657.0**, `iq4_nl` sparse 2043.0 -> **2456.7** from item 3).

**Lesson.**  The pair fusion's A/B was only ever run on qwen4exp; the dense-arm prefill A/B was never
added to the re-base checklist, so a silent aggregate-init default slipped through.  The `mmq.cuh`
fallback is the guard against the class.  See `patches/README.md` (2026-09-13 block-14 (ninth)) and
`TODO.md` (Closed).

**Test-infrastructure follow-up (same day):** added `prompts/` — versioned, hash-stable test prompts
(`prompts/README.md` records size, token count and sha256 per prompt; a shipped prompt is never edited
in place).  First entry: `prompts/prose-rdna-boosts.txt` (16074 B, 5298 tokens, `sha256 fabdec65…`),
the prompt used for the issue-#30 reproduction and the Protocol-A MTP gate.  The issue-#30 reply now
points at it instead of pasting the prompt inline, so reported numbers are tied to a committed hash.
Also added `scripts/extract-generated.py`, the backspace-aware generated-text extractor the purity gate
hashes with (a naive `sed`/`grep` slice does not reproduce the values).  Also corrected the MTP test
procedure: the drafter is the **MTP head built into the target GGUF** (`blk.<n>.nextn.*`,
`nextn_predict_layers`), used automatically when no `-md` is passed.  The old standalone
`mtp-Qwen3.8-27B-Q4_0.gguf` is a different drafter and changes the numbers (27B UD-Q4_K_XL, n3:
0.57554 acceptance / 46.9 t/s with `-md` vs 0.61654 / 47.1 t/s with the built-in head).  Docs now use
no `-md`; the separate file is not needed.

## 2026-09-13 (even later) — block-08 amendment (seventh): the fused MoE router is bit-identical — TODO item 19 closed

**Canonical chain amended in place** (block 08 `8c072080a` -> `ffa7c1c1b`, the rest replayed; new tip
**`6303f04894fa6251f7e8c9e9eff8742a24267113`**, net tree
**`311f3acebe82a65b1b6f38d3e77997c31910c7dd`**).  `patches/` regenerated from the rebuilt
`~/llama.cpp` chain; a fresh `790cf51aa` worktree + `apply-all.sh` applies **strict 16/16 `git am`**,
zero whitespace warnings, and its tree equals the amended tip tree.  `scripts/make-patches.sh` default
tip updated; the single net patch regenerated.

**The bug (TODO item 19).**  The sixth amendment's absolute `iq4_nl` text move exposed it: the fused
MoE router (`ggml_cuda_op_topk_moe`) was **not** bit-identical to the generic
`soft_max -> reshape -> argsort -> view -> get_rows -> [norm] -> [scale]` chain, and whether the fusion
fires is decided by `ggml_cuda_check_fusion_memory_ranges()`'s **buffer-address overlap** test.  So the
model output depended on the allocation plan: moving the QSA indexer `get_rows` off the CPU flipped the
fusion coverage and changed the greedy text.  Three independent gaps: (1) the fused softmax used a flat
32-lane butterfly while the generic `soft_max_f32`/`block_reduce` uses a per-warp butterfly over each
consecutive 32-column group followed by a cross-warp butterfly over the per-warp results (36 % of
random 512-value rows disagree, up to 2.4e-7 relative); (2) the fused norm accumulated the selected
weights in the per-winner lanes and multiplied by `1/sum` while the generic chain is `sum_rows -> clamp
-> div` (`weights[i] / sum`); (3) the generic CUDA argsort is a **non-stable** bitonic network, so its
top-k set/order for exact ties (4 in one 3.3k-prefill + 64-token run) disagrees with the fused
iterative argmax's smaller-index tie-break — and the CUDA CUB argsort path (`SortPairsDescending`) **is**
stable, so the two CUDA argsort implementations already disagreed with each other.

**The fix.**  `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/topk-moe.cu`: the softmax reproduces the generic two-phase
`block_reduce` order (with the `experts_per_thread == 1` single-warp path preserved), the norm sums the
selected weights in the generic `reduce_rows_f32` order (`warp_reduce_sum(lane j < n_expert_used ?
output_weights[0] : 0)`, lane `j` holding selection `j`'s weight) and **divides** by the clamped sum.
`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/argsort.cu`: the bitonic network breaks ties by index (smaller index first for
`DESC`), matching CUB and the fused router.  `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/ggml-cuda.cu`: the
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_TOPK_MOE_FUSION=1` A/B kill-switch (kept).

**Validation** (3x R9700 gfx1201, ROCm 7.14, qwen4exp `IQ4_XS`, `/tmp/prompt3k.txt`, `--seed 42
--temp 0`, `-c 32768 -b 2048 -ub 2048`):

* fused == `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_TOPK_MOE_FUSION=1` for **all eight native KV types**
  (f16/bf16/q8_0/q4_0/q4_1/q5_0/q5_1/iq4_nl), on `-sm tensor` and on `-sm layer` (the split where the
  tie divergence reproduced: `6e2290d44875` vs `8bd14f326f2b` pre-fix, one hash post-fix); forcing
  the fusion (guard ignored) gives the same hash as both.
* `plain == n_max 3 == n_max 7` within every native KV type (`iq4_nl` `086df944f6af`, `f16`
  `92d01d72f895`, `q8_0` `c4000a0285f3`, `q4_0` `28857dc2b3d1`, `bf16` `ba4d858ae2f6`, `q4_1`
  `3e04ba1e7908`, `q5_0` `348c743eb1b2`, `q5_1` `a5b6a81c33fa`) and on `-sm layer` for iq4_nl/f16.
* the pre-fix *unfused* reference is now the fused hash too (`iq4_nl` tensor `086df944f6af`; pre-fix
  fused `14a1a3f257f4` != unfused `086df944f6af`).
* MTP `n_max 3` iq4_nl acceptance 0.59091 (pos-1 0.783, mean len 2.70).
* `test-backend-ops test` **18065/18065** (`ARGSORT`/`TOP_K`/`GET_ROWS` pass; `test_argsort` data is
  tie-free by construction); 4B `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` `-sm tensor` coherence `1c5d32ac537d` unchanged
  (dense, no router).
* qwen4exp pp2048/pp8192/tg128 (`llama-bench`, iq4_nl) 1739/1748/48.1 -> 1715/1741/48.0 t/s, within the
  run-to-run noise.

**Scope note.**  The argsort change makes the CUDA bitonic path deterministic and consistent with the
CUDA CUB path; the CPU `std::sort` comparator leaves ties unspecified, so there is no cross-backend tie
contract to preserve.  See `patches/README.md` (2026-09-13 block-08 (seventh) section), `TODO.md`
(item 19 closed) and `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §31, and `upstream/UPSTREAM-PR-moe-router-tie-break.{md,patch}`.

## 2026-09-13 (later) — block-08 amendment (sixth): the `iq4_nl` `GET_ROWS` CPU fallback — TODO item 3 closed

**Canonical chain amended in place** (block 08 `de5246ada`, the rest replayed; new tip
**`ab2fabb440ac909e02e0482cabd673c339106b57`**, net tree
**`e279b222e8e98a7574814929d4b6d97edae32a48`**).  `patches/` regenerated from the rebuilt
`~/llama.cpp` chain; a fresh `790cf51aa` worktree + `apply-all.sh` applies **strict 16/16 `git am`**
and its tree equals the amended tip tree.  `scripts/make-patches.sh` default tip updated; the single
net patch regenerated.

**The bug (TODO item 3).**  qwen4exp prefill with `--cache-type-k iq4_nl` was ~8-12 % slower than
f16/`q4_0`/`q4_1` at pp8192 and the gap grew with context (pp32768 1992.1 vs 2434.5) although `iq4_nl`
and `q4_0` share the 18-byte block layout.  The QSA indexer key cache tracks `type_k`, so the indexer
gather (`ggml_get_rows` over the 128-wide indexer key view) got an `iq4_nl` source; the CUDA
`GET_ROWS` support predicate required `ne[0] % QK_K == 0` for `IQ4_NL`/`MXFP4` (those types were only
wired to the QK_K super-block kernel), and 128 % 256 != 0, so the HIP backend rejected the op and the
scheduler ran it on the **CPU**.  One `GET_ROWS` per indexer-bearing layer became a D2H/H2D round trip
with a `hipStreamSynchronize`; a qwen4exp prefill graph went from 2 to **26** splits and the GPU sat at
0.62 busy/span vs `q4_0`'s 0.958.  The dense-shortcut arm hid it below the indexer selection width
(2051), which is why pp2048 was flat.

**The fix.**  `getrows.cu` dispatches `iq4_nl` on `ne00 % QK_K` (whole super-blocks keep
`get_rows_cuda_kq<32, ..., dequantize_iq4_nl>`, any other width takes
`get_rows_cuda_q<QK4_NL, QR4_NL, dequantize_q4_nl>`); the `GET_ROWS` predicate accepts
`ne00 % QK4_NL == 0` for `IQ4_NL` (`MXFP4` keeps the `QK_K` requirement — it has no sub-block
dequantize); `test-backend-ops.cpp` gains `iq4_nl` `GET_ROWS` cases at 32/128/160/224 columns.

**Validation** (3x R9700 gfx1201, ROCm 7.14, 3-GPU `-sm tensor`):

* `test-backend-ops test -o GET_ROWS`: **219/219** (was 215; the four new sub-`QK_K` cases run on the
  GPU and match the CPU).  With `max_nmse_err()` temporarily forced to 0 for `iq4_nl`, the new path is
  **bit-exact** against the CPU at 32/128/160/224/256/512/1024 columns — the moved op itself is pure.
* Graph splits for `iq4_nl` pp4096: **142 -> 22** (`q4_0` is 22).
* qwen4exp `iq4_nl` prefill, interleaved same-session: pp8192 **1815-1951 -> 2385-2422 t/s** (= f16
  2348-2416 / `q4_0` 2316-2413); pp32768 **1754-1781 -> 2423-2430** (+36 %).
* `plain == --spec-type draft-mtp n_max 3 == n_max 7` for `iq4_nl` (tensor):
  **`c0d44c479ee1` -> `14a1a3f257f4`**; the f16 (`30d27ad1fc6d`) and `q4_0` (`912c03f2effc`) controls
  are unmoved, and the 4B `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0` `-sm tensor` coherence is `1c5d32ac537d` (unchanged).
* MTP `n_max 3` iq4_nl acceptance 0.670 -> 0.677 (pos-1 0.812 -> 0.906), both far above the gate.

**The absolute `iq4_nl` text hash moves — and it had to.**  The `get_rows` values are bit-identical,
but removing the host split changes the buffer addresses, and `ggml_cuda_check_fusion_memory_ranges()`'s
address-overlap test then flips the **MoE-router `topk_moe`** fusion coverage: pre-fix `iq4_nl` ran the
fused router for ~540 sites and the generic chain for ~612 per trace (an address-layout accident),
where `q4_0` runs 24/1128.  Post-fix `iq4_nl` is layout-identical to `q4_0`; a temporary
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_TOPK_MOE_FUSION` A/B moves the text (`14a1a3f257f4` -> `086df944f6af`), i.e. the
fused router is **not** bit-identical to the generic chain and its selection is address-dependent.
The purity invariants that matter (width `W = 1..8`, `plain == n_max 3 == n_max 7`, the controls, the
4B coherence) all hold; only `iq4_nl`'s absolute text moves.  The router-fusion address sensitivity is
filed as a new `TODO.md` item (upstream `ggml-cuda.cu`).

**Instruments.**  `GGML_SCHED_DEBUG=1` (split count) and `=2` (per-node backend assignment) are what
localised it; `rocprofv3 --kernel-trace` was used to cross-check the host-side signature.  The
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_TOPK_MOE_FUSION` A/B was a temporary instrument, reverted before landing.

## 2026-09-13 — re-based onto master `790cf51aa` (the 16-block set, 70 upstream commits)

The delivery moved from the 2026-09-08 fork point `9113cc188` to current master
**`790cf51aa`** ("chat : improve parsing of complex types in qwen3-coder (#28742)",
**70 commits** ahead).  The canonical 16-block chain was rebuilt at the new base
(tip **`43ec14228c60b0b8cb90205365c8e0aabec8bc7b`**, net tree
**`5cc664170a29cd78975f8679936d4d0adf28c605`**); `patches/` applies **strict 16/16
`git am`**, zero whitespace warnings, and the applied tree equals the canonical one.

### Upstream clashes resolved

* **`16378d93f` — CUDA/HIP: Flash Attention tuning (gfx1201)** rewrote the exact AMD-WMMA FA gate
  line block 04 owns (`Q->ne[0] <= 128` -> `<= 256`, plus a `> (ne0 <= 128 ? 8 : 16)` batch
  threshold), the `(256,256,32/64)` MMA config cases, upstream's AMD `switch_ncols2` preference
  (`gqa % 8/4/2` -> ncols1 8/4/2) and `should_use_stream_k` (stream-K on AMD only for `DKQ == 64`).
  **Head-to-head result (gfx1201, 27B head 256, single R9700, `llama-bench -r 3`, two `.so`
  variants measured interleaved):**

  | built-in `q8_0` | pp2048 | pp16384 | tg128 |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | PURE (ours) | 902.41 | 843.71 | 28.73 |
  | upstream FA | 902.02 | **847.95** | 28.75 |

  `f16`: PURE pp16384 843.7–845.0, upstream 851.0–851.5 (~+0.8 %); pp2048/tg flat; 4B Q8_0 within
  noise on both.  So upstream's tuning is worth only **~+0.5–0.9 % at `pp16384`**, flat elsewhere —
  but it **breaks the 4B decode/verify width purity** (`q4_0` `W=1 2b4c0165dc73567d` vs
  `W>=2 98e60bfd6e242b47`), while our block-04 configs return the whole band to **one hash,
  byte-identical to the (18) delivery** (`q4_0 bb6ae482f50502b3`).  Resolution: keep our
  **block-04 `(256,256,32/64)` configs** and drop upstream's AMD `switch_ncols2` block; **keep**
  upstream's `should_use_stream_k` (`DKQ == 64`) and its gate threshold (both are purity-neutral
  here and preserve upstream's stream-K preference).  Per the purity-first rule the sub-1 %
  long-prefill gain is not taken.

  > **Open finding:** the impurity is triggered by the *prefill* path yet appears as a `W=1` vs
  > `W>=2` **decode** difference for `q4_0` only, while the TILE decode is width-invariant by
  > construction.  The shipped build reproduces the validated (18) hashes exactly, so it is as pure
  > as the recorded delivery, but the underlying prefill-sensitive width sensitivity deserves a
  > proper upstream-quality repro rather than being considered fully explained.

  Full validation below.
* **`5a4d0feca` — CUDA: replace `GGML_FA_ALL_QUANTS` with `GGML_FA_QUANTS`** rewrote the FA-quant
  selection.  Block 08's 2026-09-11 enablement (`q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1` and the 15 `iq4_nl` vec
  instances) is re-homed onto the new mechanism: `iq4_nl` is added to `FA_TYPES` in
  `ggml/cmake/common.cmake`, the default `GGML_CUDA_FA_QUANTS` becomes the **eight diagonals**
  (`q4_0`, `q4_1`, `q5_0`, `q5_1`, `q8_0`, `iq4_nl`, `bf16`, `f16`), `ggml_cuda_get_fattn_vec_case()`
  gains the 15 `iq4_nl` pairs, and `ggml_cuda_fattn_kv_type_supported()` lists `iq4_nl`.
  Upstream's runtime fallback (uncompiled pair -> f16-f16 with a one-time warning) is kept, so an
  uncompiled type degrades instead of aborting.
* **`d4abd573f` — CUDA: size routed MoE MMQ N-tiles from typical expert width on RDNA3 (#28552)**
  added `int64_t ncols_opt` to `mmq_args` and switched `mul_mat_q_switch_J`'s `ntiles_x` to it.
  Merged additively with block 13's `x_gate`/`glu_op`/`glu_limit` fields and `J_max_gate` caps;
  `mmq_args args_gate = args` carries `ncols_opt` into the fused gate kernel.
* **`311d4211b` — memory: avoid allocating V cache for indexer (#28330)** sets
  `n_embd_head_k/v_mla_impl` to make the indexer cache look like MLA.  It composes additively with
  block 15 W3's `LLAMA_QSA_KEYS_ONLY` (`v_enabled=false`): both skip the dead V buffer, and W3 keeps
  its A/B kill-switch.
* **`b0dcb8192` (`common/speculative.cpp`)** renamed `common_speculative_draft_params::n_past` to
  `pos0`; block 01's added `n_cap` clamp now uses `dp.pos0`.
* **Upstream CMake refactors** (`LLAMA_CORE_SOURCES`, `llama_build`/`llama_build_and_test`) folded
  block 14's `llama-lazy-reader.cpp` / `test-lazy-reader.cpp` into the new structures; block 14's
  second `ggml_gated_delta_net` test call gained the `n_rs_batch` argument.

  dedicated MTP drafter (`/models/.../mtp-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Q4_K_M.gguf`), ctx 8192, f16 KV:
  `plain == draft-mtp n_max 3 == n_max 7` **PURE and byte-identical to the (18) delivery**
  (`87a30d8cef7a`).  The QSA-derived kq-mask probe warning ("was not used in the probe graph") is
  expected; the 8-native-KV-type qwen4exp matrix was validated on other hardware.

### Housekeeping

`scripts/make-patches.sh` default baseline/tip and `scripts/apply-all.sh`'s baseline comment now
name `790cf51aa` / `43ec14228…`; block 13's hand-carried `--- 2026-09-12 amendment ---` note was
re-inserted into `patches/0013` after regeneration (git drops `--- `-prefixed body lines).  No
delivery patch content changed apart from the rebase resolutions above.

## 2026-09-13 — CI fix: GHCR container workflow's stale commit-count assertion

The `.github/workflows/docker-ghcr.yml` apply step hard-asserted
`test "$(git rev-list --count HEAD)" -eq 16` ("base commit + 15 block commits") and
`git log --oneline -15`.  It was authored 2026-09-10, when the set was 15 blocks
(block 00 + blocks 01-14 = 16 commits); **block 15 was promoted 2026-09-12**, making
the set 16 blocks and the applied history **17 commits**.  The patches still applied
strict 16/16 `git am` and `apply-all.sh` reported success, so the sanity check — not
the delivery — aborted every matrix job (all three ROCm entries) with exit code 1
before any image was built (runs 34733460496, 34733771241).

Fix: derive the expected count from the patch set instead of hardcoding it, so it
cannot drift on the next block:

```sh
n_blocks="$(find "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/patches" -maxdepth 1 -name '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-*.patch' | wc -l)"
test "$(git rev-list --count HEAD)" -eq "$((n_blocks + 1))"
git log --oneline -"$n_blocks"
```

The header comment now also says `patches/0000..0015 (block 00 + blocks 01-15)`.
Reproduced the exact CI step locally with a fresh `9113cc188` tarball + `apply-all.sh`:
16 patches -> 17 commits, dynamic check passes (the old `-eq 16` fails as observed).
The three base image tags (`rocm/dev-ubuntu-24.04:{7.2.4-complete,7.14.1-full,10.0.0-full}`)
were confirmed to exist, so the pipeline can proceed past the fixed step.  No delivery
patch content changed.

## 2026-09-12 (18) — block-13 amendment: dense mmvq weight per-(type, K) nwarps (targeted MoE recovery)

Follow-up to (16)/(17).  The (16) band-uniform RDNA4 `nwarps = 1` fixed the dense verify widths but
cost the MoE model's **dense** Q8_0 layers ~9 % at single-token decode (diagnosed in (17); the MoE
expert kernel does not use `calc_nwarps`, so the loss is the dense MUL_MATs).  The dense mmvq
**weight** kernel `mul_mat_vec_q_ksplit` now picks `nwarps` **per `(type, K)`** via a new
`calc_nwarps_weight()`: RDNA4 + `Q8_0` + `K < 4096` -> the pre-2026-09-11 wide block (`nwarps = 8`),
every other shape -> 1.  `K = ncols_x >= 4096` is computed host-side and threaded as a compile-time
`long_k` template bool (launch bounds and the shared-memory-sized reduction stay compile-time).
Crucially the **pinned fusion ops keep plain `calc_nwarps`** (their `calc_nwarps(GGML_TYPE_Q8_0, 1,
...)` call is a single-token reduction-order anchor) — leaking the rule into them made the 27B `f16`
KV width probe impure at W=1; scoping it fixed that.

**Measured** (1 GPU; MoE 35B-A3B f16 `-ntg 64`, dense 27B UD-Q4_K_XL q8_0):

| metric | (17) `nwarps=1` | (18) per-(type,K) |
|---|---|---|
| dense MTP `n_max 7` | 35.75 | 35.65 (~0, 27B bit-identical) |
| dense B=8 | 2.865 | 2.875 (~0) |
| MoE B=1 plain | 0.7835 | **0.752 (+4.0 %)** |
| MoE MTP `n_max 3` | 161.0 | **164.2 (+2.0 %)** |
| MoE MTP `n_max 7` | 159.5 (acc 0.63115) | **177.1 (+10.0 %, acc 0.73148)** |
| MoE B=8 batched TG | 1.4445 | 1.485 (−2.8 %) |

The 27B is bit-identical (Q8_0 K >= 5120 -> `long_k` -> 1), so the dense issue-#30 fix is untouched;
the MoE batched B=8 cost is the deliberate trade and still beats the pre-(16) 1.494.

**The opposite assignment was measured and rejected**: giving the dense kernel the MoE expert
kernel's wide VDR=4 on the same short-K Q8_0 shapes buys 1.6 % on the batched B=8 but cancels the
MTP gain (`n_max 7` 177.1 -> 161.2, acceptance back to 0.63115).  The two knobs have independent
per-kernel optima — dense wants wide `nwarps` + narrow `VDR`, the MoE expert kernel wants wide `VDR`.

**Validation** (clean-apply build): 4B all-8-KV-type width probe **PURE** with re-pinned hashes
(`f16` `e3c53c3432c7815b`, `bf16` `7254fecf4a9728df`, `q8_0` `46a961911ca1fc12`, `q4_0`
`bb6ae482f50502b3`, `q4_1` `32df01d9f1c4aef1`, `q5_0` `b15ab98c50aa8f51`, `q5_1` `bed6c581183172ce`,
`iq4_nl` `b73b73f83ef30a12`); 27B `q8_0`/`f16`/`bf16` probe **bit-identical** to (17); 27B 8-KV-type
text gate **bit-identical** to (17); MoE plain `W=1..8` PURE; `test-backend-ops` ROCm0
**17999/17999**.

**Clean-apply**: canonical rebuild at `9113cc188` + the regenerated 16-patch set, strict **16/16**
`git am`, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree **`c2e284c2acc032238ef85cb35d427c1598ed0949`**
(rebuilt canonical tip `907799de3e6a7dcbd206d03b2daef4c248144ca9`).  Block 0013 is the only content
change vs the (17) regeneration; block 13's hand-carried RDNA3_5 note is preserved.

## 2026-09-12 (17) — block-10 amendment: the mmvq VDR is per kernel (dense upstream, MoE expert block-10)

Follow-up to (16).  The (16) revert of block 10's `VDR=4` was **global**; a code read shows the
**MoE expert kernel** `mul_mat_vec_q_moe` (the `MUL_MAT_ID` path) is *not* reached by the block-08
`nwarps` change (it launches `(warp_size, ncols_dst)` — one warp per token — and never calls
`calc_nwarps`) but *is* reached by `get_vdr_mmvq`/`get_vec_dot_q_cuda`, so the global revert took the
wide chunk from the one kernel it was tuned for.  The VDR is now selected **per kernel**: the dense
`mul_mat_vec_q` (item-split), `_ksplit` and their fused variants keep the upstream VDR
(Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K 2/2/1, Q8_0 2, `moe = false` default); `mul_mat_vec_q_moe` takes block 10's values
through `get_vec_dot_q_cuda(type, true)` / `get_vdr_mmvq(type, true)` — Q4_K/Q5_K `..._vdr4`, Q6_K
`..._vdr2`, Q8_0 `vec_dot_q8_0_q8_1_moe` (`VDR_Q8_0_Q8_1_MMVQ_MOE`, 4 on RDNA4/RDNA3_0, else 2).
`vecdotq.cuh` returns to the block with the `_vdr4`/`_vdr2` functions **only** — the dense macros
stay upstream, so `hc-mix.cu` and every dense reference hash are unchanged.  Both kernels stay
band-uniform internally (the VDR is a compile-time per-type constant).

**Measured** (1 GPU gfx1201; MoE 35B-A3B Q4_K_M f16 `-ntg 64`, dense 27B UD-Q4_K_XL q8_0 `-ntg 32`;
`llama-batched-bench` TG total seconds, MoE MTP `draft-mtp n_max 3`):

| build | dense B=1 | dense B=8 | MoE B=1 | MoE B=8 | MoE MTP n3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| pre-(16) | 1.149 | 3.915 | 0.713 | 1.494 | 166.6 t/s |
| (16) amended | 1.175 | 2.798 | 0.782 | 1.506 | 160.2 t/s |
| **(17) per-kernel VDR** | 1.174 | **2.795** | 0.783 | **1.452** | 161.2 t/s |

So (17) keeps the dense fix and recovers the **VDR-caused part** of the MoE loss (B=8 1.506 -> 1.452,
better than pre-(16)).

**Correction to the (16) attribution**: the *larger* MoE single-token/MTP loss is the band-uniform
`nwarps = 1` on the dense layers, **not** the VDR.  A diagnostic build restoring the pre-(16)
per-type `nwarps = 8` (RDNA4) while keeping the per-kernel VDR recovers MoE B=1 to **0.716 s** and
MoE MTP to **167.4 t/s** — but costs dense MTP (35.9 -> 34.3 t/s at `n_max 7`) and MoE B=8
(1.452 -> 1.499).  The 27B's Q8_0 decode path is hit too, so no per-type split satisfies both models
(the same Q8_0 type serves the MoE attention and the 27B decode).  `nwarps = 1` is kept — it is what
the (16) dense verify fix requires — and the residual MoE single-token/MTP delta is a **documented
trade**, not a fixed regression.

**Validation** (clean-apply `deliver-verify` build): the 4B all-8-native-KV-type width probe and the
27B `q8_0`/`f16`/`bf16` probe reproduce every (16) hash; the 27B 8-KV-type text gate
(`plain == mtp3 == mtp7`) reproduces every (16) hash; dense MTP `n_max 7` 35.9 t/s / `n_max 3`
46.7 t/s; MoE MTP `n_max 3` 161.2 t/s / acceptance 0.87179; `test-backend-ops` ROCm0
**17999/17999** passed, 0 FAIL.

**Clean-apply**: canonical rebuild at `9113cc188` + the regenerated 16-patch set, strict **16/16**
`git am`, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree **`2833f1369bdea4cb45f68f85dbb2898fd98aab66`**
(rebuilt canonical tip `a05225f7361ea5a1116d7185ebec8867cfe4afe2`).  Block 0010 is the only content
change vs the (16) regeneration; block 13's hand-carried 2026-09-12 RDNA3_5 note is preserved.

## 2026-09-12 (16) — block-08 + block-10 amendment: the MTP decode regression (issue #30)

Issue **#30** (briansp2020, single R9700 gfx1201, dense **Qwen3.8-27B UD-Q4_K_XL**, `q8_0` KV)
reported the delivery ~14 % **slower** on MTP decode than stock `9113cc188` at the same fork point,
with much faster prefill.  Reproduced on the maintainer rig (27B UD-Q4_K_XL, `q8_0` KV, 1 GPU): stock
`--spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 8 --spec-draft-p-min 0.55` **37.51 t/s** vs the delivery
**30.34 t/s**; plain decode was fine (delivery slightly faster).  Root cause, via
`llama-batched-bench` (no speculation, so no acceptance confound) — the **multi-token verify path**
was up to **+35 %** slower at B=8, and the penalty grew with width from B=3 on.  Two band-uniform
mmvq knobs (made uniform by the 2026-09-11 MTP purity work, but left at their **single-token-tuned
values**):

* **block 10** — the `VDR=4` mmvq boost for Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K (the 32-element-per-call variants lose on
the verify widths).  **Reverted in full** (`vecdotq.cuh` back to the upstream VDR set — Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K
2/2/1, Q8_0 2); `vecdotq.cuh` drops out of the block.
* **block 08** — the RDNA4 `calc_nwarps` per-type whitelist (`nwarps=8` for the simple-vec_dot types,
only ever tuned at `ncols_dst == 1`).  The RDNA4 band is now **band-uniform `nwarps=1`**; RDNA3_0 and
RDNA3_5 tables unchanged.

**Result** (27B UD-Q4_K_XL, `q8_0` KV, 1 GPU; `llama-batched-bench` TG total for 32 steps):

| build | plain | B=1 | B=4 | B=8 | MTP n_max 7 | acc | MTP n_max 3 | acc | MTP-adaptive n_max 7 | acc |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| stock `9113cc188` | 28.25 | 1.157 | 1.726 | 2.929 | 37.51 | 0.484 | — | — | — (no adaptive) | — |
| delivery (pre-amendment) | 29.34 | 1.147 | 2.121 | 3.958 | 30.34 | 0.466 | — | — | 30.57 | 0.4201 |
| **amended** | 28.62 | 1.175 | 1.657 | **2.798** | **36.32** | 0.475 | **40.15** | 0.611 | **38.47** | 0.4226 |

So the amended **verify path is faster than stock's** and the residual MTP difference is the
single-token `nwarps=8` (B=1 1.175 vs 1.157) that the band-uniform purity constraint forbids, plus the
`n_max 7` clamp.  The `nwarps` sweep (band-uniform 1/2/4/8 → B=8 2.790/2.894/3.162/3.307, MTP
36.59/36.00/33.91/32.78) picks **1**; single-token is flat (1.160–1.175) and per-type mixing never
helped.

**Validation** (amended clean-apply build, `deliver-verify`):
* **width probe** (`logits-dump-kv`, W=1..8): 4B **all 8 native KV types** PURE; 27B `q8_0`/`f16`/`bf16`
  PURE.
* **text gate** (`--spec-type none` == `draft-mtp n_max 3` == `n_max 7`), 27B, **all 8 native KV
  types** byte-identical.
* **MoE MTP gate** (35B-A3B Q4_K_M, 1 GPU, f16 KV): plain 84.3 → `draft-mtp n_max 3` **160.2 t/s**,
  acceptance **0.87179** (unchanged).
* **`test-backend-ops`**: ROCm0 **17999/17999** passed, 0 FAIL.
* Same-seed coherence: coherent; the 4B reference re-baselines `f069f69475e7` → `3eeb3d9d333e`
  (deliberate reduction-order change).

**Clean-apply**: canonical rebuild at `9113cc188` + the regenerated set, strict **16/16** `git am`, zero
whitespace warnings, applied tree **`56a1c5f23c54c038f78d7242dc05b181d872b69b`** (canonical tip for
this rebuild `1837856e3f8120449090c0f44594427573a541ed`).  Only blocks 0008 and 0010 change content;
block 13's hand-carried 2026-09-12 RDNA3_5 amendment paragraph is re-added to the patch body (it is
dropped by `git am` scissors handling).

**Gate gap closed**: `../benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md` gains a stock-relative
verify-width `llama-batched-bench` check — the existing gate only tested acceptance at the default
depth 3 and `llama-bench tg128` (the one width that never regressed).

## 2026-09-12 (15) — block 15 promoted to the delivery (TODO item 1 closed)

The attention-memory campaign (block 15) was **promoted from `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/` to the
delivery**.  The beta window closed with the maintainer's go-ahead; the beta patch is now
`patches/0015-rdna-boosts-block-15-campaign-memory-wins.patch`, so the delivery is a **16-patch set**
(block 00 + blocks 01-15) and `scripts/apply-all.sh` / `scripts/make-patches.sh` are 16-block flows
(the old "beta patch applied manually on top of the 15-block tree" flow is gone).

* **Clean-apply**: a canonical fork rebuilt at `9113cc188` from the current `patches/`
  (`scripts/apply-all.sh`, strictly) produced tree `3b0874b6aa367fea846a437b45f1689bd173b38c`; the
  promoted block-15 patch applied on top with strict `git am` (no `-3`), producing the re-validated
  beta tree **`c3142fe0b311757f458647f172f623859f5bc983`** and canonical 16-block tip
  **`0f4f83f9ef01ffd1662f58d714d62b9155325a62`**.  A fresh worktree at `9113cc188` + the updated
  `apply-all.sh` then applied strict **16/16** `git am`, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree ==
  `c3142fe0b3`.
* **Patch identity**: `patches/0015` is byte-identical to the beta patch except its `From <sha>` line;
  blocks `0000`-`0014` were regenerated from the canonical rebuild and are byte-identical to the
  previous delivery apart from the `From` lines and the `[PATCH NN/14]` -> `[PATCH NN/15]` series
  denominator (block 13's hand-carried 2026-09-12 RDNA3_5 amendment paragraph is preserved verifiably
  — it is dropped by `git am`'s scissors handling, so it is re-added to the patch body as before).
* **`rdna-boosts-all.patch`** regenerated as `git diff 9113cc188..0f4f83f9e` (127 files).
* **The seven wins and their gates are unchanged** (W4 has no gate; V4/V5 share the opt-in
  `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE`, default 0).  The revalidation that the promotion rests on reproduced every
  reserve number to the last decimal, the width-probe reference hashes (1 GPU `4089b4d4`, 2-GPU tensor
  `a4817ee6`, 3-GPU tensor `91434ea9`; `W=9` divergent as accepted), byte-identical same-seed coherence
  across gates on 4B / gemma-4-E4B (ISWA) / gemma-4-31B (ISWA) / 27B (short + 40k) / qwen4exp, the op
  suites (`FLASH_ATTN_EXT` 7859/7859 ROCm0 + CPU, `GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46, `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 22/22),
  the unchanged MTP gate (27B `0.76744`, qwen4exp `0.44262`), and the W4 round trip 56.00 -> 16.00 MiB.
  The accepted W2-`iq4_nl` ULP caveat is recorded in `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/BETA-TESTING.md` §4d.
* **Docs**: `patches/README.md` (the 0015 row + the promotion section), `README.md`, `MANIFESTS.md`,
  `BASELINE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TODO.md` (item 1 moved to Closed) and the beta README (marked
  **PROMOTED**) all moved to the 16-patch state.  The block-15 gate table, the per-win mechanism notes
  and the gfx1151 pass stay in `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/README.md`;
  `archive/work/strix-halo/GATE-2026-09-10-block15-rdna35.md` is the gfx1151 record.

## 2026-09-12 (14) — gfx1151 cross-check of the block-14 (eighth) fix: TODO item 4 fully closed

TODO item 17 (the gfx1151 cross-check) is resolved and item 4 is fully closed.  Validated on gfx1151
(Strix Halo, ROCm 7.14 at `/opt/rocm-7.14-gfx1151`) against branch `block14-band-uniformity`: fresh
worktree at `9113cc188` + `scripts/apply-all.sh` -> strict **15/15** `git am`, 0 whitespace warnings,
applied tree **`3b0874b6aa367fea846a437b45f1689bd173b38c`** (== canonical).

* **The forced-sparse text residual is gone.**  `LLAMA_QSA_DENSE_DECODE_UNTIL=0` + q8_0 + `p5000.txt`
  (seed 42, temp 0, n 128, `-sm layer`): pre-fix (the amendment-7 build) `plain a57bc13bbf2a` vs n3
  `3124adfd2b94` (first diff **char 458**); post-fix `plain == n3 == a57bc13bbf2a` (632 chars).  All
  eight native KV types are pure in the forced-sparse regime (f16 `cb2912b186b9`, bf16 `945f89766e3c`,
  q8_0 `a57bc13bbf2a`, q4_0 `9afd1d55a5ae`, q4_1 `aff1978cf720`, q5_0 `296f8ebcd246`, q5_1
  `a88803f4ebf9`, iq4_nl `8e4437794660`); pre-fix only q8_0 and q5_0 were impure.  **The full
  n_max 1/2/3/5/7 sweep is pure for all eight native KV types in *both* the forced-sparse and the
  default (dense) regimes.**  Default (dense) gates unchanged: q8_0 `e8f8bba3942b` (626), f16
  `0fc4910d5824` (632).
* **The `mstep` matrix is 0 mismatches at every width**: `W = 1,2,3,4,5,8` (forced-sparse q8_0) all PURE
  with a stable `Thash = ea713a1c1f515bc1`, **unchanged vs the pre-fix build**.  (gfx1151's mstep was
  already pure at default params pre-fix, unlike gfx1201's W=2/W>=3 boundary, so the text gate is the
  discriminator on this arch.)
* **Op suites**: `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` **22/22**, `GATED_DELTA_NET` **46/46**, `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5935/5935**.
* **MTP acceptance (Protocol A, n_max 3)**: forced-sparse q8_0 `0.51333` (77/150), pos-1
  `(0.740, 0.420, 0.380)`; default q8_0 `0.57554` (80/139) and default f16 `0.51678` (77/149) =
  bit-identical to the pre-fix values.
* **Beta**: the 17th block-15 re-cut applies cleanly on the new tree (`git am -3` -> tree
  `c3142fe0b311757f458647f172f623859f5bc983`, the recorded beta tree).
* **Outcome**: TODO item 4(b) dropped from *Documented* and item 17 closed; the delivery branch merges
  into `main` with no code change beyond the (eighth) amendment already in `patches/`.  Records: this
  entry, `TODO.md`, `patches/README.md` (the (eighth) section), `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §29, the harness
  `archive/work/strix-halo/qsa-item4/`.

## 2026-09-12 (13) — block-14 amendment (eighth): the QSA indexer-score decode/verify band-uniformity fix

Block-14 amendment (eighth), found by the gfx1201 investigation of TODO item 4's q8_0 forced-sparse
residual.  Canonical tip `c6f1e8e78` -> **`d306d4b4b`** (tree `e1e42e23c` ->
**`3b0874b6aa367fea846a437b45f1689bd173b38c`**); block 14 amended in place (the tip block, so no
replay), `make-patches.sh` default tip updated, `rdna-boosts-all.patch` regenerated; strict **15/15**
`git am` on a fresh worktree at `9113cc188` (0 whitespace warnings, applied tree == canonical).

* **The defect**: the QSA indexer score's matmul carries the indexer heads in its N dimension, so its
  `ne11` is `n_idx_h * n_tps` (**4 * n_tps** for qwen4exp).  Block 08's "keep the verify batch on the
  decode kernel" guard (`ne11_mmvf = ne11 <= MMVF_MAX_BATCH_SIZE ? 1 : ne11`) assumed `ne11` *is* the
  token count, so from `n_tps = 3` the guard stopped rescuing the verify batch: decode (`n_tps = 1`)
  stayed on the MMVF family while the verify fell through to MMF, and the two families accumulate the
  truncated dot product differently.  The indexer score then differed by a ULP and flipped a top-k
  near-tie - the forward was **bit-identical to decode for 101 steps and then diverged** at target
  position 4395.  On the `p5000` prompt the greedy **text** happened to stay equal, so it was a
  logits-level `plain != draft-mtp` violation, not a visible text change.
* **How it was found** (gfx1201, 3x R9700): a `mstep` width matrix showed W=2 pure, W>=3 impure with the
  first divergence at a fixed position (4395, not the first batch), i.e. a selection flip rather than
  drift; `LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0` / `LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1` were pure and block-15's gates irrelevant.  A
  `rocprofv3 --kernel-trace` diff of W=2 vs W=3 showed the only exclusive kernels were ncols-templated
  MMVF/ksplit variants, with the score moving from `mul_mat_vec_f<float,float,8,64>` (N=8) to no MMVF
  instantiation at W=3.  Forcing the fallback family for *every* F32 matmul (a temporary diagnostic)
  made the band pure again - confirming "one family across the band" as the fix.
* **The fix**: `MMVF_MAX_BATCH_SIZE_FLAT` (`= MMVF_MAX_BATCH_SIZE * 4 = 32`) in `mmvf.cuh`; the block-08
  guard widened to it in `ggml-cuda.cu`; `mul_mat_vec_f_cuda_switch_ncols_dst` instantiates
  `ncols_dst` 9..32 in `mmvf.cu` (+168 lines).  The guard stays at the decode family (MMVF) so the
  verified arithmetic is the one the draft's single-token decode reproduces.  The guard is block 08's;
  block 14 extends it because block 14 is the block that introduces the flattened batch.
* **Validation (canonical delivery tree, gfx1201, 3x R9700, layer split)**: `mstep` W = **1,2,3,4,5,8**
  q8_0 all **0 mismatches** (pre-fix W>=3 impure), and the W=1 reference `Thash` is unchanged
  (`2bd73063dd0a9524`) so **decode numerics are untouched**; f16 W=4 pure; forced-sparse q8_0 and
  default text gates byte-identical (`a4cdc10dfb6c` 678 chars / `2e078b6966c0` 682 chars);
  `FLASH_ATTN_QSA`, `GATED_DELTA_NET` and `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` all OK (4/4 backends); 27B dense
  `plain == n_max 3` (`da2e2d192e21`); MTP acceptance healthy (forced-sparse q8_0 `0.46497`, pos-1
  `(0.698, 0.415, 0.264)`; default `0.44444`, pos-1 `(0.673, 0.418, 0.218)`).
* **No delivery behaviour change outside the flattened band**: for `ne11 <= 8` (decode/verify of every
  ordinary op) and `ne11 > 32` (prefill) the guard decision is unchanged, so dense models are
  unaffected by construction (verified: 27B `plain == draft-mtp`).
* **Open cross-check** (confirmed 2026-09-12 (14): the gfx1151 forced-sparse text residual is gone and
  all eight native KV types are pure — see the (14) entry): whether this also removes the gfx1151
  `plain != draft-mtp` text residual that
  `TODO.md` *Documented* records (same signature, different arch - gfx1151's `mstep` was reported pure)
  is to be confirmed by the gfx1151 box against this branch.  The fix is arch-independent in the engine
  (per-arch MMVF tables aside), so the branch is the test vehicle.

## 2026-09-12 (12) — TODO item 4 closed: the block-14 MTP-export logits-purity fix + the q8_0 forced-sparse residual recorded as a limitation

TODO item 4 is closed.  It had two sub-items; **(a)** is fixed and landed as a block-14
amendment (seventh), **(b)** survives a genuine driver-level investigation and is recorded as a
measured, deliberately-NOT-fixed limitation.  Canonical tip `47a9d4d86` ->
**`c6f1e8e78cfb2a70958998cdd81fad363e869f93`** (tree `c24871386c479865d41476726cf1f01c43b23ea6` ->
**`e1e42e23c2913cd529b0064eb1cb74525a746098`**); block 14 amended in place (the tip block, so no
replay), `make-patches.sh` default tip updated; strict **15/15** `git am` on a fresh worktree at
`9113cc188` (0 whitespace warnings, applied tree == canonical); `rdna-boosts-all.patch`
regenerated; beta block-15 **re-cut 16th** (`bdd09891d588225e139a67e510094d972acd1858`, tree
`3a47913c0bdca7f1154a8f0310a20435a36c0faa`, patch 206 454 bytes, round-tripped strict `git am`).

* **(a) `embeddings_nextn` broke logits-level `plain == draft-mtp` on qwen4exp.**  The unmasked MTP
export needs a hidden row for every prefill token, so the last layer's output-row gather was
deferred; the last layer's ffn tail then ran on the full ubatch and the prefill's last-position
logits shifted by a ULP (`ad3acaa75d19ddf2` vs `b624a79f19b1b1f0`).  The last layer now always
gathers the output rows before its tail (exactly the plain path) and builds a **second, full-row
tail** solely for `t_h_nextn` when the chunk drops rows (`n_outputs < n_tokens`); a decode/verify
batch drops none, so nothing is duplicated there.  **Verified (gfx1151):** the `mstep` `NEXTN=1`
prefill mismatch is gone (`0` mismatches; was `1` at `pos = 4293`); the `W=4 RB=3 RS=3 JUNK=1`
width probe is `0` mismatches and the `W=8` 38-mismatch position list is byte-identical pre/post
(all 38 positions); default and forced-sparse text gates byte-identical (`e8f8bba3942b` /
`0fc4910d5824`); MTP acceptance bit-identical (f16 `0.51678` = 77/149 both builds); the graph is a
no-op on every non-NEXTN path (the gather already ran with `gather_now == true`).  Instrument:
`archive/work/strix-halo/qsa-item4/`.
* **(b) the forced-sparse shallow q8_0 residual is recorded, not fixed.**  Repro:
`LLAMA_QSA_DENSE_DECODE_UNTIL=0` + `-ctk/-ctv q8_0` + `p5000.txt` + `draft-mtp n3` on qwen4exp ->
`plain a57bc13bbf2a` vs `n3 3124adfd2b94` (632/657 chars).  A logits-level first divergence was
localised with a temporary target-logits dump in the real `server-context.cpp` driver: at target
position **4432** the accepted token is identical (381) but the target logits argmax flips
**264 -> 9859** - a QSA-indexer *selection/state* divergence, not a forward width dependence (the
`mstep` replay is bit-pure).  Excluded on the current tip: forward width (`mstep` W=1..8 pure), the
GDN rollback bound and checkpoint restore (`n_rs_seq = 16` forced - still diverges;
`test-recurrent-state-rollback` PASS), `n_outputs_max`, CUDA-graph capture, the chunked-prefill
boundary, the fused indexer score and the derived cache (both bypassed with quantized keys), and the
sparse FA kernel (`LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0` does not fix it - the shared dense masked path is
affected).  `LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1` fixes it and `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0` only perturbs the trajectory to
purity; the delivery default (dense decode below 64K) is pure, so this is a forced-arm,
prompt-dependent, q8_0-only low-severity limitation.  Record:
`archive/work/strix-halo/RECORD-2026-09-12-qsa-item4-deep-dive.md` + `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §18/§28.
* **Gates (gfx1151, current tip):** `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 22/22, `GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46, `FLASH_ATTN_EXT`
5935/5935; dense-masked oracle (Sherlock corpus, 4x4096, f16) sparse `1.0539` vs dense `1.0544`;
band purity default q8_0/f16 pure and forced-sparse f16 pure; `draft-mtp n_max 3/5/7` acceptance /
text unchanged; beta re-cut revalidated (`GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46, `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 22/22,
`test-recurrent-state-rollback` PASS, the four gate combos + `draft-mtp n_max 3` all
`0fc4910d5824`).
* **No new Active item**; item 4 is removed from Active with a Closed one-liner, and the residual is
one entry in *Documented, deliberately NOT fixed*.

## 2026-09-12 (10) — block-02 amendment: the chunked-GDN snapshot bound (`n_rs_batch`) + the pre-batch slot

Integrated from the gfx1201 investigation in `~/ngram-mod/` (record: `archive/work/gdn-rs-rollback/README.md`;
originals `~/ngram-mod/{README.md,fix-ngram-mod.md,gdn-rs-rollback-bound.patch}`).  Canonical tip
`890a9c5b1` -> **`47a9d4d86`** (tree `0edf654cdea653b9969f866977a541ee4429f846` ->
**`c24871386c479865d41476726cf1f01c43b23ea6`**); block 02 amended in place and blocks 03-14 replayed with
**no conflicts** (the net delta is byte-exactly the patch: 20 files, +96/-23), and patch bodies
`0003`-`0014` changed **only in their `From`/`index` lines plus hunk offsets** (verified: all 52 changed
lines in `0014` are hunk headers).  `make-patches.sh` default tip updated; strict 15/15 `git am` on a
fresh worktree at `9113cc188` (0 whitespace warnings, applied tree == canonical); beta block-15
**re-cut 15th** (`eb15f3ee1`, tree `ffa3a11c30ba6d42dea2520f402126370df3bbb6`, patch 3 819 lines,
round-tripped, cherry-pick clean).

* **The defect**: the whole-batch chunked GDN path wrote no rollback snapshots for batches above its
  threshold, on the assumption that such a batch is "not a verify batch".  `n_rs_seq` comes from
  `speculative.draft.n_max` (7) but `--spec-ngram-mod-n-max` can draft 64, so a 65-token verify batch
  took the chunked path and a small tail rollback restored an unwritten plane - a silent
  recurrent-state rewind.  The block-02 `seq_rm` guard (2026-09-11) is the detector; the reported
  warning is real.
* **The fix**: `n_rs_batch` (longest draft any enabled speculator can produce + 1, from
  `common_speculative_n_max()`) is threaded `llama_context_params` -> `llama_cparams` ->
  `ggml_gated_delta_net()` op param 1 -> the CUDA dispatch, where the threshold becomes
  `max(K > 16 ? K : 16, n_rs_batch)`; plus the pre-batch ssm/conv state is written into slot
  `n_tokens` when `0 < n_tokens < K`, so a whole-batch rollback has the state it needs.  No snapshot
  memory change (sizing `n_rs_seq = 64` would have cost ~+8 GiB).
* **Validation (gfx1151)**: in-tree `test-recurrent-state-rollback` **FAIL -> PASS** (unpatched:
  `multi-seq split replay logits mismatch (max diff 6.5366, first at seq 0 pos 16)`; patched:
  `matched (max diff 0)` for both cache fills + the seq-1-only case); `GATED_DELTA_NET` **46/46**;
  neutrality: 27B `plain == draft-mtp n_max 7` = `e164f09af338` and qwen4exp `plain` = `0fc4910d5824`
  identical before/after, 27B pp2048/8192 within noise; beta re-cut revalidated (`GATED_DELTA_NET`
  46/46, `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 22/22, rollback test PASS, all four gate combos + `draft-mtp n_max 3`
  byte-identical `0fc4910d5824`).
* Trade recorded: batches in `(max(K,16), n_rs_batch]` now run the sequential kernel (correctness
  requires it - the chunked kernel cannot write those snapshots).  Delivery configs are unaffected
  because their `n_rs_batch <= 16`.

## 2026-09-12 (9) — TODO item 9 resolved and closed: the configurable QSA prefill arm + the device-query arm gate

Block-14 amendment (sixth).  Canonical tip `13af95ac1` -> **`890a9c5b1`** (tree
`f4791066f4a582316b1ca95f51c96cd10b905ef7` -> **`0edf654cdea653b9969f866977a541ee4429f846`**);
`make-patches.sh` default tip updated; strict 15/15 `git am` re-verified on a fresh worktree at
`9113cc188` (0 whitespace warnings, applied tree == canonical); beta block-15 **re-cut 14th** on the
new base (`86c7df1f5`, tree `66f0762a2ec19cbc34b1842d1b5984bb82ecec45`, patch 3 819 lines,
round-tripped).  Full record: `archive/work/strix-halo/qsa-item9/RECORD-2026-09-12-qsa-prefill-crossover.md`.

* **9(a) the prefill arm is now configurable, and its default is the documented policy: `0` = QSA
  prefill always.**  Prefill previously had no depth axis at all (only the decode crossover
  `qsa_dense_decode_until`), so `qsa_dense_prefill_until` (env `LLAMA_QSA_DENSE_PREFILL_UNTIL`,
  `K/M/G`, `0` disables the arm) is a genuine addition; a prefill ubatch whose `n_kv` is still below
  the threshold attends dense while storing the indexer keys, so the sparse path takes over above it.
  The default is `0` on every arch and split because that is the ARCH POLICY -- `beta/qwen4exp/README.md`
  ("decode uses the dense attend below a per-arch depth and QSA above; **prefill is always QSA**") and
  the 2026-09-07 crossover record ("**Soar: QSA for prefill ALWAYS** (wins from ~8K, monotonically to
  +181 % @160K); dense for decode ALWAYS"; Halo from ~16K).  **The delivery's default behaviour is
  therefore byte-identical to the pre-amendment build** (f16 `0fc4910d5824`, q8_0 `e8f8bba3942b` = the
  recorded pre-amendment shallow values; `plain == draft-mtp n_max 3 == n_max 7`), so no reference hash
  moves, and the arm ships as an opt-in A/B.
  *Correction recorded on purpose:* this session's first pass set a default (gfx1151 8192, tensor split
  16384) from a **whole-prompt** `llama-bench` A/B plus a parenthetical in `patches/README.md`, and the
  maintainer corrected it -- the gfx1201 decision is QSA prefill always, dense never better.  The
  2026-09-07 record already carried the reason that A/B cannot decide a default: its tables are
  `pp2048` measured *at depth*, and it explicitly rejects the shape ("the old \"dense wins prefill at
  30K\" record is obsolete ... also a non-comparable whole-prompt llama-cli banner").  The A/B numbers
  are kept in the record as a description of what the knob does, flagged non-comparable, and the
  default is the policy.
* **9(b) the arm gate asks the device instead of mirroring the kernel's type list.**  `qsa_kv_native`
  was a hand-maintained copy of `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_qsa_supported()` (kept in lockstep by comment)
  and its staleness is what made the 2026-09-11 third amendment an abort in the meta splitter instead
  of a fallback.  `qsa_op_supported()` now builds a minimal probe tensor and asks
  `ggml_backend_dev_supports_op(model.dev_layer(il), probe)`; under `-sm tensor` that device is the
  Meta device, whose `supports_op()` is `all_of(sub-devs)`, so the query is the meta-split safety
  condition.  The `LLM_FUSED_OP_FLASH_ATTN_QSA` probe the item suggested is structurally impossible
  (a QSA node exists only above the 2051 selection width, so a reserve-time probe graph has none).
  Probe table: 0 mismatches vs the old list on gfx1151, plus an unsupported head size (D=80) now
  rejected where the list accepted it; same-seed text byte-identical to the pre-amendment build;
  cost 0.112 us/call.
* **Gates:** strict 15/15 apply (tree == canonical) and `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 22/22 + `FLASH_ATTN_EXT`
  pass; the default is byte-identical to the pre-amendment build (f16 `0fc4910d5824` 632 chars for
  `plain == n_max 3`, q8_0 `e8f8bba3942b` 626 chars for `plain == n_max 7`); beta re-cut builds clean,
  its `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` suite is 22/22, and all four gate combos (default / `GGML_QSA_SCORE_MEM=0` /
  `GGML_QSA_DERIVED_*=0` / `LLAMA_QSA_KEYS_ONLY=0`) plus `draft-mtp n_max 3` are byte-identical
  (`0fc4910d5824`, 632 chars) = the delivery's value.  The 14th re-cut also **folded the missing
  `nullptr, nullptr` argument into the beta commit**: the 13th re-cut's exported patch had it only in
  the worktree, not in the commit, so a clean `git am` of that patch would not have compiled.
* **TODO**: item 9 removed from Active (Closed one-liner added); Active is now items 3 and 4 only.
  One observation recorded, not filed as an item: on the substitute PPL text the halo sparse path
  reads 24.71 against the same selection computed densely at 22.28 - the documented oracle text is
  absent on this box, so this is not comparable with the recorded 6.5267/6.5306 parity and is left as
  an observation (the patch does not touch that path).

## 2026-09-12 (8) — TODO triage: Active cut from 13 items to 3, item 11 closed with a measurement

No delivery change (one experiment implemented, measured and **reverted**).

- **Item 11 (MXFP4/NVFP4 fused gate+up+GLU MMQ) attempted and closed — the type-list edit is a no-op.**
  Implemented the planned change (`GGML_TYPE_MXFP4` in `MMQ_GATE_TYPES` + the generated gate instance, the
  `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q_switch_type_gate` case, `moe_mmq_type`), built it, and instrumented the gate case
  with a one-shot counter: **0 firings** over a full `gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4` prefill with the arm enabled.
  The model's MoE graph is the expert-bias `{MUL_MAT_ID, ADD_ID, MUL_MAT_ID, ADD_ID, GLU}` pattern, whose
  only fused arm is the **mmvq/decode** one — there is no MMQ (prefill) fused arm for it and the MMQ
  fused epilogue has no `x_bias`/`gate_bias`/scale support.  Perf ~0 (pp2048 1741.3 vs 1742.0 t/s,
  pp16384 1506.7 vs 1501.6, fused vs `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MOE_MMQ_FUSION=1`), same-seed text byte-identical.
  Experiment reverted; `wip`-free.  Side finding: `generate_cu_files.py`'s `SOURCE_MMQ_GATE` re-emits the
  file header on append, so re-running the generator mutates the 5 committed gate instance files.
- **TODO restructure (the point of the session):** Active is now only what this repo will work on next —
  items **3** (`iq4_nl` prefill), **4** (QSA sparse residual + the `embeddings_nextn` logits caveat) and
  **9** (QSA knobs).  Items 1/6/8/12 → *Waiting on others* (maintainer go-ahead, other hardware, upstream
  filing); 5(c)/5(d)/5(g)/13 → *accepted limitations* (item 5(d): the mmq `sum[]` overflow is latent — no
  upstream config violates `I >= nwarps*16`, so there is no reproducer to file); 5(a)/5(b)/15/16 →
  *Parked*; item 14 → *Closed* (canonical chain re-verified at `13af95ac1`).  No item content was deleted —
  every moved item keeps its body under the new heading, and the details stay in the dated records.

## 2026-09-12 (7) — item 16 re-scoped (the "pin" plan is a dead end) and item 15's `-Wshadow` audit

No delivery change.

- **TODO item 16** (restore the ~0.9 % `tg128` the block-13 RDNA3_5 fusion skip costs): the suggested
  "pin `nwarps`/`rps`/item-split" fix does **not** apply.  Verified against the delivery: the fused and
  unfused dense `ncols_dst==1` arms already share the same `mul_mat_vec_q_ksplit<…,has_fusion,…>`
  template, the same `calc_nwarps(type,1,table_id)` (RDNA3_5: 2 for `Q8_0`, else 1), `rows_per_block` 1
  and identical launch dims; the fused epilogue uses the same `ggml_cuda_op_silu_single` as the standalone
  GLU (`op_silu`), and `up * silu(gate)` is commutative.  Two live candidates: **(a) codegen**
  (`has_fusion` adds registers + a second `vec_dot` in the inner loop and may contract the `tmp` FMAs
  differently) and **(b) the Q8_1 cache** (`common.cuh:1611` — keyed on the src1 tensor/layout only, not
  the weight type, while `quantize_row_q8_1_cuda` takes `src0->type`; fusing changes which call fills it).
  Next step: dump `tmp`/`tmp_gate` from the ksplit kernel under an env at `W=1`.  Record
  `archive/work/strix-halo/rdna35-mmvq-fusion-purity/README.md` §9.
- **TODO item 15** (`-Wshadow` for `src/`, which would have caught the Block-15 dead-mask bug): audited by
  replaying the tree's own host compile commands for the 186 `src/` TUs with `-Wshadow` — **128 warnings
  in 27 files**, 46 of them the risky `shadows a local variable` class (82 are benign `shadows a field`,
  mostly constructor params).  `src/models/qwen4exp.cpp` is clean.  Revised proposal:
  `-Wshadow -Wno-shadow-field-in-constructor` for `src/` + fix the ~46 local sites in their own cleanup
  block.  Record `archive/work/shadow-warnings/RECORD-2026-09-12-shadow-audit.md` (full 46-site list).

## 2026-09-12 (6) — QSA forced-sparse q8_0 residual (TODO item 4): it is not a width dependence; `embeddings_nextn` breaks logits-level `plain == draft-mtp`

No delivery change.  Deep dive on the one open item-4 residual (forced sparse + `-ctk q8_0` + the
`p5000` prompt: `plain a57bc13bbf2a` vs `n3 3124adfd2b94`).

- **It is not a decode/verify width dependence.**  A new multi-step teacher-forced replay
  (`archive/work/strix-halo/qsa-item4/mstep.cpp`) of the plain greedy sequence in the exact residual config is
  bit-pure at every width: 200 positions, `W = 1..8`, with a spec-like batch+rollback schedule, with
  unrelated tokens in the rolled-back rows, and with `n_rs_seq` 0 vs 2/3 — 0 mismatches.  The recurrent
  snapshot rollback restore is exact and rolled-back content does not leak.
- **Sharp signature:** pure at `--spec-draft-n-max 1` (MTP genuinely active, 31.1 t/s vs plain 23.7);
  `n_max 2/3/5/7` all land on the *same* divergent text (first diff char 458).
- **Ruled out:** `n_rs_seq`, `n_outputs_max` (`1+n_max`), CUDA-graph capture (`GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=0`),
  and the chunked-GDN prefill boundary — the boundary is a real hazard (moving it by one token changes
  the text) and it is why `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0` moves the *plain* stream at char 49, but an
  instrumented `gated_delta_net.cu` shows the actual chunked-GDN call sequence is **identical** between
  the runs (144 calls, same sizes).  So `GDN_CHUNKED=0` / `DISABLE_FUSION=1` "reconcile" by perturbing
  the trajectory, not by localising the cause (correcting the earlier record's reading).
- **New concrete defect:** the MTP driver enables the target's `embeddings_nextn`
  (`common/speculative.cpp:1431`), which makes qwen4exp's last-layer output gather defer
  (`gather_now` in `src/models/qwen4exp.cpp`) so the last layer runs on the full ubatch — the **prefill's
  last-position logits shift by a ULP** (`ad3acaa7…` vs `b624a79f…`).  That is a real logits-level
  violation of the `plain == draft-mtp` guarantee (item 4(a)), though it does not by itself flip the
  replayed tokens.
- **Disposition:** item 4 stays open, re-scoped to a driver-level divergence; the next step is a faithful
  mini-MTP driver (target + draft, per-step target-logit dump), since everything cheaper is exhausted.
  Records: `archive/work/strix-halo/RECORD-2026-09-12-qsa-item4-deep-dive.md`; analysis `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §18;

## 2026-09-12 (4) — QSA sparse-regime width purity on gfx1151: items 4/7 re-measured (item 4 re-scoped, item 7 closed)

No delivery change.  Re-measured the two QSA-*sparse*-regime width dependences that TODO item 4 recorded
on 2026-09-11 (on the 3-GPU gfx1201 box, sparse arm forced) — both were measured **before** the
2026-09-12 block-13 RDNA3_5 mmvq-fusion amendment, and **neither reproduces on gfx1151 with the current
delivery**:

- the fused indexer score **is** byte-identical to the per-op chain: a 512-token forced-sparse A/B
  (qwen4exp UD-IQ4_XS, f16/bf16, `P=5000`) gives the same text for `GGML_CUDA_QSA_INDEXER_SCORE` and
  `_CACHE` at their defaults and at 0 (`0d29890e0f04` f16), and the `CACHE=2` unfilled-pool probe does
  move the W=1 text (so the fused path is the one running);
- the recorded "residual split" was the block-13 single-token mmvq fusion (§25): the current delivery is
  `plain == n3 = cb2912b186b9`, and the pre-fix impurity reproduces exactly with
  `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_RDNA3_5_SINGLE_TOKEN_FUSIONS=1` (`471ea250f8e2` vs `cb2912b186b9`).

**Default gfx1151 configs are pure**: shallow dense decode on every tested KV type (q8_0 included) and
deep sparse decode at ~74K (f16 `83e0ed0f0f80`, q8_0 `7205399d367d` — the maintainer's `-ctk q8_0`
config).  Item 7 (the "dense decode at every depth" workaround) is therefore **closed** — the 64K
crossover stays.

One residual remains and is **open/unlocalised**: a prompt-dependent q8_0 width dependence in the
*forced*-sparse shallow regime (`LLAMA_QSA_DENSE_DECODE_UNTIL=0`, `/tmp/p5000.txt`: `plain a57bc13bbf2a`
vs `n3 3124adfd2b94`).  `LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0` does not reconcile it (the standard masked-FA path is
affected too), `LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1` does, and `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_FUSION=1` / `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0` each
perturb to purity.  It is a ULP-level effect (the default deep q8_0 config is pure).  Next step: a
node-dump/op-trace rebuild to diff the W=1 and W=4 graphs.  Item 4 is re-scoped to this.  Record:
`archive/work/strix-halo/RECORD-2026-09-12-qsa-sparse-width.md`; analysis `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §18; docs updated
(`AGENTS.md`, `TODO.md`).

## 2026-09-12 (5) — item 5(f): the block-13 fused MoE gate+up+GLU arm still wins on Strix Halo

Re-measured on the current delivery tip (35B-A3B Q4_K_M, 1 GPU, interleaved
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MOE_MMQ_FUSION` off/on ×3, pp2048 and pp16384): the fusion is still worth
**+0.6 %** prefill at both sizes (pp2048 1711.9/1710.2 vs 1710.1/1701.4 t/s; pp16384 1485.3/1485.8 vs
1476.4/1478.6 — the first p2048 off-run 1733.3 is a warm-up outlier) and the fusion fires, so TODO item
5(f) is **closed: keep the arm**.  Docs-only; no delivery change.

## 2026-09-12 (3) — TODO.md audit: the Active list is active-only, closed items moved out, state header refreshed

Docs-only tracker cleanup (no delivery change).  `TODO.md`'s *Active* list had accumulated finished-work
footnotes, so the file no longer told a reader what was actually open: item 2 was an empty heading for the
fixed issue-25 GDN divergence (heading deleted; already in Closed), item 1's Block-15 dense-arm blocker
narrative was a Closed record repeated in Active (trimmed to the live 12th-re-cut + beta-window state),
item 6 carried the completed gfx1201 port and Phase-2.5 narrative (moved to Closed, leaving only the open
gfx1100/gfx1151 legs), item 5(e) (gfx1100/gfx1201) duplicated item 6 and was dropped, and the state header
still named the superseded canonical tip `124abba9e` / tree `d7c8e898…` (now `13af95ac1` /
`f4791066f4…`, matching `make-patches.sh`).  Added the Closed one-liner for the 2026-09-12 (2) block-13
RDNA3_5 mmvq-fusion purity amendment and a new Active item 16 for its perf follow-up (make the fused
`ncols_dst==1` kernels reproduce the standalone reduction rather than skip the fusion).  Also prepared the
post-compaction brief `archive/work/strix-halo/HANDOVER-2026-09-12-remaining-gfx1151.md`.

## 2026-09-12 (2) — block 13: the RDNA3_5 single-token-only mmvq fusions are not decode/verify bit-identical (folded)

**Canonical tip `13af95ac1`** (tree `f4791066f4a582316b1ca95f51c96cd10b905ef7`), 15 blocks,
clean-apply strict 15/15 `git am` with 0 whitespace warnings and the applied tree equal to the
canonical one.  One block amendment (block 13), one net-patch regeneration.  Full record:
`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §25 and the (now folded) `archive/work/strix-halo/rdna35-mmvq-fusion-purity/README.md`.

**Block 13 — the two RDNA3_5 single-token-only mmvq fusions are skipped on gfx1151.**  The
2026-09-11 block-13 band work made the *standalone* mmvq path `W = 1..8`-uniform, but on gfx1151 two
**single-token-only** fusions still ran at `W=1` only and their fused kernels do not reproduce the
standalone arithmetic, so a 1-token decode and an n-token verify of the same layer were not
bit-identical (the issue-25 "block-13 `n_q=1` short-K mmvq variance"): the dense gate+up+GLU mmvq
fusion (`mul_mat_vec_q<..., ncols=1, has_fusion=true>`; `mmvq.cu` restricts fusion to `ncols_dst == 1`)
and the MoE weighted-down tail `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_id_weighted_rdna3_5` (RDNA3_5-only, single-token by
its shape fingerprint).  Measured (qwen4exp UD-IQ4_XS, `P=100`, f16): `W=1` `8abc6206` vs `W=8`
`453eaa61`; each fusion moves `W=1` independently and only both together equal the `W=8` standalone.
The fix guards the six `{op,op,GLU}`/`{op,bias,op,bias,GLU}` matchers in `ggml_cuda_try_fuse` (keeping
the band-uniform `MUL_MAT_ID`/MoE fusions) and `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_id_weighted_rdna3_5_ok`, both gated
on RDNA3_5 unless `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_RDNA3_5_SINGLE_TOKEN_FUSIONS=1` (A/B).  Post-fix `W = 1,2,4,8` is
one hash per config: qwen4exp f16 `453eaa61`, q8_0 `113696b9`, MoE 35B-A3B `18999a78`; the 27B dense
(`e165ef98`) was already pure and is unchanged.  Cost ≈ −0.9 % `tg128` on qwen4exp (25.53 vs 25.77
t/s), prefill flat — the §19 trade; the follow-up is to make the fused `ncols_dst==1` kernel reproduce
the standalone reduction instead of skipping the fusion.  The gfx1201 path is untouched
(`GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3_5`-only).

**Placement.**  The dense GLU matchers are upstream at the fork point and the weighted-down `_ok` is a
block-13 addition, so the whole fix lands in block 13 — not block 00 (which is generated from the fork
point and touches only `fattn-common.cuh` + Vulkan shaders, and the weighted-down matcher does not
exist there), and not block 14 (which owns the weighted-down *matcher*; guarding in `_ok` keeps block
13 self-contained and avoids a mid-chain rebase of block 14's overlapping `ggml-cuda.cu` hunks).

**Regeneration.**  Rebuilt the canonical chain by `scripts/apply-all.sh` at `9113cc188` from the
pre-amendment `main` patches, amended block 13 (`f5d0cdd25`), replayed block 14 (`13af95ac1`) and ran
`scripts/make-patches.sh`; blocks 00-12 and 14 patch bodies are byte-identical apart from the
`From`/`index`/hunk-header lines, only block 13's body changed.  `rdna-boosts-all.patch` regenerated
(`git diff 9113cc188 13af95ac1`) and verified equal to the regenerated `patches/` applied at the base.

**Beta block-15 re-cut (12th).**  Re-cut on this base: base `13af95ac1`, beta tip `888a59ee0`, tree
`476d2d1e95947de7cc8cd806c40efc0f01927cd3`; the exported patch is byte-identical to the 11th re-cut
apart from the `From <sha>` line (block 13's amendment touches only `ggml-cuda.cu`/`mmvq.cu`, which the
block-15 patch does not touch), and strict `git am` applies.  Beta-tree revalidation: build clean;
width probe `W = 1,4,8` one hash on qwen4exp f16 (`453eaa61`) / q8_0 (`113696b9`); a same-seed greedy
run is byte-identical delivery-vs-beta; `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` + `GATED_DELTA_NET` pass.  See
`archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/BETA-TESTING.md` (12th-re-cut section).

## 2026-09-12 — block 13: the fused shared-expert epilogue is column-blocked (the item-5 cost repaid), and the routed-compact MoE MMQ claim re-verified

**Canonical tip `124abba9e`** (tree `d7c8e8984b8bd65838d8ae58c0f5de449d9c5d4d`), 15 blocks, clean-apply
strict 15/15 with 0 whitespace warnings and the applied tree equal to the canonical one; the sim build
(`/tmp/simx`) reproduces the MoE probe gate `ac8825358d9adfda` at `W = 1,4,8`.  One block amendment
(block 13), one staged-beta re-cut (11th), one validation record (the gfx1201 routed-compact probe).
Both items come from `TODO.md` items 10 and 6, worked to the brief
`archive/work/items-6-10-wrapup/HANDOVER-2026-09-12-items-6-and-10.md`.

**Block 13 — `shexp_down_gated_q8_0` is now column-blocked (band-internal).**  The 2026-09-11 band
amendment made the fused shared-expert epilogue serve the whole decode/verify band but launched it as
`grid = (nrows, ncols)` — one block per `(output row, token)` — so the down-weight row was re-read once
per token and the whole block (two barriers, the cross-warp reduction and the epilogue) was duplicated
per token.  On the reachable geometry this is severe: for Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (`k_down` 512 → 16 k-blocks,
`vdr` 4, `nwarps` 8) `blocks_per_iter` = 128 > 16, so **only warp 0 of 8 does any work** (88 % of the
block idles) and the weight row is read 8x over at `pl = 8`.

The kernel is now templated on `ncols_dst` as well, with the **token loop inside the k-block loop**, a
per-token accumulator per thread and the weight block read once per `(row, k-block)` for the whole band;
`grid` is `(nrows)` with the band block-internal.  Two invariants are preserved exactly, which is what
makes the change numerically invisible:

* `nwarps` stays pinned to the single-token value (`calc_nwarps(GGML_Q8_0, 1, table_id)`), because it
  sets `blocks_per_iter` and hence the down-projection reduction order;
* each token keeps the single-token path's per-thread accumulation order *and* the same cross-warp
  reduction order (serial `sh_down[l]` adds in `l` order, then `warp_reduce_sum`), so `decode == verify`
  holds by construction, not by measurement.  The `__fmul_rn` epilogue (no FMA contraction) and the
  `dst[t*nrows + row]` layout are unchanged.

Perf (`llama-batched-bench`, 35B-A3B Q4_K_M, 3-GPU tensor, `-npp 2048 -ntg 128 -npl 1,2,4,8`, f16 KV,
two interleaved reps, `pl` is the batch width = `n_max + 1`):

| `pl` | before (fused) | after (fused) | unfused reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 95.84 / 95.64 | 95.57 / 95.55 | 93.55 / 93.11 |
| 2 | 167.69 / 167.48 | 168.65 / 168.45 | 165.88 / 165.02 |
| 4 | 299.07 / 299.49 | **306.52 / 305.79** | 299.86 / 299.96 |
| 8 | 461.00 / 461.09 | **475.41 / 473.07** | 472.65 / 470.72 |

i.e. `pl 8 +3.1 %`, `pl 4 +2.4 %`, `pl 2 +0.6 %`, `pl 1` flat — and the fused default is now **ahead of**
the unfused `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SHEXP_DOWN_GATE=1` reference at every width, where before it lost 2.4 % at
`pl 8`.  With `--spec-draft-n-max` capped at 7 the payout band is exactly `pl <= 8`, the widest
*supported* verify batch.

Numerical invisibility was proven with a **direct old-vs-new A/B** (both `libggml-hip.so` builds of the
same tip kept side by side and swapped in, the `tools/sobench.sh` idiom) rather than by trusting
documented values:

* MoE probe (`/tmp/lw-f2`, 1 GPU, `SPLIT=layer`, `RS=0`, `CB=0`, `P=256`, `p0long.txt`): fused
  `W = 1..8` **all `ac8825358d9adfda`** before and after; unfused all `bd138ad2326fbbf2` before and
  after.  Both are the documented gate values, so the fix is a **no-op at the gate config** — the
  strongest available control.
* The §5 acceptance matrix is unchanged: qwen4exp tensor all-W `dcf1ae667f730879`, layer
  `3adeb313042a871b`; 27B layer `4089b4d40b91090c`, tensor `91434ea90f2cbfa0`.
* §19 text gate on 35B-A3B (Protocol A prompt, 96 tokens, 1 GPU, f16 KV):
  `--spec-type none == draft-mtp n_max 3 == n_max 7` = `68c0a24ed8d4` (447 chars) before and after.
* MTP acceptance (Protocol A, `n_max 3`, `n=96`): `0.87179` before and after (identical
  `68 accepted / 78 generated`, mean len 3.62).
* `test-backend-ops`: `FLASH_ATTN_EXT`, `FLASH_ATTN_QSA`, `GATED_DELTA_NET` all pass on ROCm 0/1/2.
* The change also leaves qwen4exp's documented sparse text `804de0576868` untouched (re-checked while
  validating the re-cut).

**Beta re-cut (11th).**  Base `124abba9e` → beta tip **`a90f75896`**, tree
**`ed6ee74df8b690c5a1584adb3f85c45eda70a09b`**, patch still **3 811 lines**; `git am -3` applies with no
conflict and the exported patch differs from the 10th re-cut **only in the `From <sha>` line** (block 13's
amendment does not touch any file the beta patch hunk-touches).  Round-tripped (fresh worktree at the base
+ `git am -3` → identical tree), builds clean (`/tmp/blk15z/build-rec11`), and the smoke gates reproduce
the 10th re-cut's values exactly: qwen4exp f16 sparse text `804de0576868`, QSA oracle sparse `6.5394` /
dense `6.5377`.

**Item 6 — the gfx1201 routed-compact MoE MMQ ("Phase 2.5") re-verified; two corrections.**  The port's
in-code claim is "*Numerics are bit-identical to the plain `mul_mat_q` path (same `mul_mat_q_process_tile`,
same per-tile accumulation order; only the tile enumeration differs)*".  Re-checked on the current tip
with `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MMQ_ROUTED` on/off:

* **Byte-identity holds, on two different expert types/J bands.**  qwen4exp (IQ4_XS, J=64): same-seed
  greedy text `804de0576868` both ways; 35B-A3B Q4_K_M (Q4_K, J=32): `68c0a24ed8d4` both ways.  Probe
  hashes `W = 1..8` identical on both models under both settings (MoE `ac8825358d9adfda`, qwen4exp tensor
  `dcf1ae667f730879`), and the MoE MTP acceptance is `0.87179` either way.
* **Correction 1 — the brief's premise was wrong.**  It assumed the 35B-A3B Q4_K_M does *not* take the
  routed path and could serve as the "plain" control.  It does: `mmq_rdna3_5_id_use_compact` accepts
  Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K, and a `rocprofv3 --kernel-trace` count shows **480
  `mul_mat_q_routed_compact<(ggml_type)12, 32, false>`** launches per `pp512`/`ub512` run (type 12 =
  Q4_K, J = 32), i.e. the Q4_K experts take it too.  Both available MoE models therefore exercise the
  compact dispatch — which *strengthens* the validation to two type/J bands but removes the proposed
  control.  The control is instead the **prefill-only reach**: a `tg` run shows **0** compact launches
  and **0** descriptor-builder launches, because decode and the verify band go through mmvq
  (`ncols_dst <= MMQ_MAX_BATCH_SIZE`), which is also why the compact dispatch cannot affect width
  purity.
* **Correction 2 — the env opt-out does not isolate the whole port.**  `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MMQ_ROUTED=1`
  disables only the compact *enumeration*; the per-expert J selection (`mmq_rdna3_5_id_get_J` in
  `mul_mat_q_switch_J`) stays active in both arms (the code says so explicitly).  So ON==OFF proves the
  compact enumeration is arithmetic-neutral, not the J selection.  The J change is arithmetic-neutral by
  construction (J is the output-row tile width; an output element's accumulation is over K only), and it
  is additionally covered by the delivered hash table, the MoE probe/text/MTP gates above and
  `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT_ID` (which also passes).
* Perf claim re-measured (interleaved, 2 reps, ub2048, 3-GPU tensor, f16 KV, `-r 2`): qwen4exp pp512
  **+11.1 % / +9.3 %**, pp2048 **+5.6 % / +4.6 %**, pp8192 **+4.5 % / +3.1 %**, pp16384
  **+4.0 % / +3.6 %**, tg128 flat (51.57 vs 51.58); 35B-A3B pp512 **+5.1 % / +5.3 %**, pp2048
  **+7.7 % / +7.8 %**, pp8192 **+7.4 % / +7.2 %**, pp16384 **+6.9 % / +7.0 %**, tg128 flat (99.61 vs
  99.45).  The 2026-09-06 record's "+4-8 % prefill, tg flat" is reproduced on both models.

**One measurement caveat recorded for the follow-ups.**  The cross-day comparison against the port's
2026-09-06 *absolute* numbers is not usable: qwen4exp `pp2048` (f16 KV, same config) ran
2042.6 -> 1933.7 -> 1906.1 -> 1822.0 -> 1730.8 t/s over one session (a monotone -15 % drift while the box
sits at 141 GiB buff/cache with swap full), while the 35B-A3B `pp512` control reproduced to 0.2 % in the
same window (5372.2 vs 5360.1/5353.9).  Only same-session interleaved brackets are meaningful for this
model's prefill; the same warning is now on `TODO.md` item 3 (the qwen4exp `iq4_nl` prefill-delta item,
which is an 8-12 % claim measured on this same axis).  A quick QSA-arm check in the same window
(`LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1` +2.2 % pp2048 / +7.4 % pp8192, `LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0` +2.3 % / +2.7 %) shows the QSA
machinery is *not* the explanation for the drift.

**Pushing/tips:** `scripts/make-patches.sh` default tip -> `124abba9e`; `rdna-boosts-all.patch`
regenerated by hand (22 347 lines, 115 files, `git apply --check` clean at `9113cc188` and a full apply
reproduces the canonical tree).

## 2026-09-11 (12) — mixed K/V types hard-rejected, `--spec-draft-n-max` capped at 7, and issue #25's GDN divergence re-verified

**Canonical tip `484231cb9`** (tree `fc3c73da4ac68e92348043b992fb963b006e14df`), 15 blocks, clean-apply
strict 15/15 with 0 whitespace warnings and the applied tree equal to the canonical one (sim build
verified).  Two block amendments, both from maintainer decisions of 2026-09-11:

**Block 14 — mixed K/V cache types are now HARD-REJECTED for every model.**  Upstream enforces
`type_k == type_v` for MLA/DeepSeek4 only; the condition is dropped, so `params.type_k !=
params.type_v` now fails context creation for every architecture with

```
E llama_init_from_model: models require the same K and V cache types, got K=q8_0 and V=f16; set
  --cache-type-v to match --cache-type-k (both default to f16)
```

Rationale (measured, `TODO.md` accepted limitations / `GREEDY-PURITY.md`): every mixed pair is
1.7–3.6× slower than the same-type equivalent and never smaller, and the attention path — including the
split/flash-attention one, whose type gate lives a few lines above — assumes `type_k == type_v`.  Both
types default to f16, so only an explicit `--cache-type-k`/`-v` can trigger it.  Verified: `-ctk q8_0`
(V=f16) and `-ctk q8_0 -ctv q4_0` both fail with the message above; `-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0` runs normally.

**Block 01 — `--spec-draft-n-max` is capped at 7** (a clamp with a visible notice, **not** an error,
per the maintainer's instruction).  A verify batch decodes `n_max + 1` query rows and the HIP
flash-attention chooser switches the band from the tile kernel to the MMA/WMMA kernel above 8 rows
(`fattn.cu`, the `Q->ne[1] > 8` switch); the two kernels are not bit-identical, so a deeper draft makes
decode and verify disagree and greedy output can change between `--spec-type none` and `draft-mtp`
(upstream master has the same class of boundary).  The guarantee published in `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §11 is
therefore enforced rather than documented:

* the clamp lives in **`common_init_from_params`**, not in the argument parser, because a warning
  emitted while parsing is *below the default log threshold* and never reaches the user (verified: the
  control `--log-mmap` combination warning is equally invisible; `--log-verbosity 4` shows both) — it
  runs before the model/context and before the speculative engine are created, so all of them see the
  capped depth;
* the notice is emitted at `LOG_ERR` level deliberately (llama-cli's default verbosity hides `W` but
  shows `E`; `common_fit_params` uses the same pattern for its non-fatal abort notice) and **names the
  escape hatch**: `LLAMA_SPEC_DRAFT_N_MAX_CLAMP=0` keeps the configured value (with a `W` notice);
* the help string now reads "(default: 3, max: 7)".

Verified end to end on the 27B (2-GPU): `--spec-draft-n-max 12` → the notice **at the default
verbosity** and the GDN log line showing `K=8` (= n_max 7 + 1); `LLAMA_SPEC_DRAFT_N_MAX_CLAMP=0` →
`K=13` (= 12 + 1, i.e. the env really reaches the kernels) with the "keeping it" notice; `n_max 7` and
`n_max 4` are silent and give `K=8`/`K=5`.  Note (documented in the code): unclamping to `n_max > 15`
re-introduces the K-dependent chunked-GDN boundary as well.

**Issue #25's GDN plain-vs-spec divergence: already fixed, re-verified, and the records corrected.**
A concurrent gfx1151 session reported that `--spec-type none` and `draft-mtp` disagreed through the GDN
chunked prefill.  That was fixed on 2026-09-11 by block 02's **K-independent whole-batch chunked
prefill** (`GGML_CUDA_GDN_ALIGN_BOUNDARY` and both K-dependent branches deleted); the `TODO.md` item and
the `archive/work/issue-25-mtp-batch-width/` status lines still described the superseded opt-in gate, and are now
corrected.  **Fresh gate on the current tree** (27B Q8_0, 2-GPU `-sm tensor -ts 1/1`, `p0long.txt`, 512
greedy tokens, `-c 8192 -ctk f16 -ctv f16 -fa auto`): `--spec-type none == draft-mtp n_max 1 == 4 ==
5`, all `299566b902bb` (2727 chars) — byte-identical.  Control: `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0` changes the
plain text (`60777872b890`), which is the expected chunked-vs-sequential kernel difference (and that
switch remains the fully-snapshot-safe fallback), not a plain-vs-spec divergence.

**Beta:** tenth re-cut — base `484231cb9` → beta tip **`a796a1d49`**, tree
**`b48565e69f77f0c20a20cd75d87c2559d11e6de2`**, patch **3 811 lines**; `git am -3` merged the new
`llama-context.cpp` region **without a conflict**, and the diff vs the ninth re-cut is exactly the three
new delivery files (`common/arg.cpp`, `common/common.cpp`, `src/llama-context.cpp`) — no block-15 content
changed.  Beta testers must pass matching `-ctk`/`-ctv` from now on (the hard reject applies to the beta
too); see `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/BETA-TESTING.md`.

## 2026-09-11 (11) — Block 15's dense-arm blocker fixed (a shadowed variable); no delivery change

**Delivery unchanged** (`main` still the 15-patch set at canonical tip `6d3155faa`, tree
`0c3f0c2c2f4e7439d9489d45573a4021a8eee106`): the defect lived in block 15's own `build_attn_qsa` dense
path, which is **not** in the delivery (the delivery has no `if (kq_mask != nullptr)` wrapper and no outer
declaration), so nothing in `patches/` changes.  Only the staged beta patch is amended — the ninth re-cut.

**Root cause (one line, found by instrumentation after every hypothesis in the handover was excluded):**
the V2/V3 refactor wrapped the top-k mask chain in `if (kq_mask != nullptr) { ... }` and declared an
*outer* `ggml_tensor * kq_mask_top_k = nullptr;`, leaving the chain's own
`ggml_tensor * kq_mask_top_k = ggml_set_rows(...)` inside the block as a **new local**.  The chain was
therefore built whenever the mask existed, but its result never reached the attention — `build_attn_mha`
received the outer `nullptr`.  Consequences: the chain's nodes were unreachable from the graph output (so
`ggml_build_forward_expand` never emitted them), the packed mask lost its only consumer (the allocator
left it unallocated, and block 15's own `if (self_kq_mask && self_kq_mask->buffer)` guard in
`llm_graph_input_attn_kv::set_input` then skipped `set_input_kq_mask`), and the dense arm attended with **no
mask at all** — a full causal leak.  Fix: drop the inner `ggml_tensor *` so the block assigns the outer
variable.

**How it was isolated** (full detail: `archive/work/block15-dense-arm/HANDOVER-2026-09-11-block15-dense-arm.md`):
the dense arm also differed in a plain text run; it *still* differed with `-fa off` (⇒ not the FA kernels,
not V3's derived-mask arm); `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/ab/w4-revert.patch` + rebuild changed nothing (⇒
not W4); `LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED=0` removed the resolver's derived-mask warnings (a working positive
control) but not the leak (⇒ not V3); then the node dump
(`archive/work/kv-quant-purity-followups/tools/node-dump-instrumentation.patch`, `GGML_CUDA_NODE_DUMP=1/2` +
`/tmp/nodedump_on`, `--verbose` needed for the ggml-level INFO lines) showed the delivery's dense prefill
consuming `attn_inp_kq_mask` 36 times (12 indexer layers × 3 devices) while the beta consumed it **zero**
times and emitted **no** `FILL`/`SET_ROWS` chain nodes at all; a temporary `[QDM]` log then printed
`kq_mask=1` (the guard passes) with `outer_top_k=0` (what the attention reads is still null) — the
shadowing, in one line.  A cheap by-product instrument is now the first thing to try for any "is the model
seeing the future?" question: **random text** (`/tmp/rand-text.txt`, 40 000 random words) — a model that
can see the target scores ≈1 on noise, where the broken beta gave `1.0205` and the delivery `19.0589`.

**Gates after the fix (identical configs, against the delivery build):**
`tools/qsa-ppl-oracle.sh tensor f16` → sparse `6.5394` / dense `6.5377` (= the delivery; the blocker's
`1.0558` is gone); dense-arm greedy texts byte-identical to the delivery — tensor f16 `2daa19579316` (720
chars), tensor `iq4_nl` `3c46e47ab345` (680), layer f16 `e656b50f2cc8` (685), layer f16 `-fa off`
`b96459bf02ca` (703); random-text PPL `19.0589` @ c2560/ub2560 and `7.9682` @ c4096/ub512 (= the delivery);
production arm untouched — sparse f16 `804de0576868`, q4_1 `886292b17a93`, `plain == n_max 3 == n_max 7`,
MTP f16 `acc 0.56028` / pos-1 `(0.681, 0.553, 0.447)` bit-identical to the delivery on the same command,
`LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1` `6.5376`; the KV reserves are unchanged by the fix and still show the campaign's
mask-elision win (`1600.00 + 600.00` MiB at c204800/ub512 f16 vs the delivery's `1600.00 + 1800.00`, in
both arms); backend suites OK.  The pre-existing `iq4_nl` W2 sensitivity is unchanged (its greedy text
`fcb2d47f94cf` and MTP `0.46203`/`(0.717, 0.434, 0.226)` stay off the delivery's values, and
`GGML_QSA_DERIVED_* =0` restores them exactly — verified) because the sparse arm never enters the fixed
block.

**Beta:** ninth re-cut — base `6d3155faa` → beta tip **`3712e2dc1`**, tree
**`e39f8c2b6f0593113b93c4e57c512bc7373a2250`**, patch **3 811 lines** (the 8th re-cut + 1 diff line + the
commit-message paragraph); `git am -3` on a fresh base reproduces the tree exactly.  Records:
`archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/{README,BETA-TESTING,HANDOVER}.md`; the revalidation pointer in
`TODO.md`.

**Lessons recorded in `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §23:** (1) a graph tensor with no consumer is *silently* dropped —
the allocator leaves it unallocated and the input fill is skipped, so "the input is in the graph" proves
nothing; (2) in a refactor that adds an outer declaration, an inner `Type * name = ...` **shadows** it and
the result is dead code that still compiles — `-Wshadow` (not currently enabled) would have caught this
class outright; (3) when a chain's nodes are missing from an executed-graph dump, suspect the *graph
builder* (reachability), not the allocator.

## 2026-09-11 (10) — `iq4_nl` becomes a first-class FA KV type (F3 step 2), and the beta re-cut finds a Block 15 blocker

**Canonical tip `6d3155faa`** (block 08 amended a fifth time, block 14 a fifth time), net tree
`0c3f0c2c2f4e7439d9489d45573a4021a8eee106`, 15 blocks, clean-apply strict 15/15 with 0 whitespace
warnings and the applied tree equal to the canonical one; the sim build's generated text is
byte-identical to the canonical build's (only its `build : <sha>` banner line differs, because the sim
chain has its own commit SHAs) and its `iq4_nl` text gate reproduces the canonical value.  Delivery
`main` carries the regenerated set (`rdna-boosts-all.patch` 22 233 lines, 115 files, +17 203/-935) and
the **8th** block-15 beta re-cut (`d0f71b2e8`, tree `39540b7f4fd8e8569dee64bfa3ee84bf1b20e75d`, patch
3 787 lines).

**The task: F3 step 2 = `iq4_nl`** (brief
`archive/work/kv-quant-purity-followups/HANDOVER-2026-09-11-f3-step2-iq4_nl.md`) — the last sub-`q8_0` KV type,
and the smallest cache of the set (288 MiB at c=32768 on the 4B, tied with `q4_0`, -72 % vs f16).
Before this, `iq4_nl` produced **no flash-attention call at all**: the predicate's `default:` clause
rejected it, the FA probe then disabled FA for the whole context.  After: **4B pp512 2269.8 -> 7931.8
t/s, tg32 48.5 -> 95.0** (`q4_0` 7913.1/96.8, f16 7981.7/99.7); dense models unchanged (27B 3-GPU
tensor pp8192/16384 within 0.7 % of f16, 4B pp8192 -2 %); `-sm tensor` now accepts the type.

**The mechanics were bookkeeping, not a new kernel** — the tile/MMA families stage K/V through
`ggml_get_to_fp16_cuda`, which already covers `iq4_nl` upstream.  What was missing: the predicate case,
the **15 `fattn-vec-instance-iq4_nl-*.cu` pairs** (upstream's generated cross product never had them
because `TYPES_KV` did not list the type - they ship with that list now, and `FA_ALL_QUANTS` gains its
15 pairs so that build mode stays complete), the K-side `vec_dot_fattn_vec_KQ_iq4_nl` (perm-based
`get_int_from_table_16` lookup, no bias) and V-side `dequantize_V_iq4_nl` (the q4_0/q5_0 nibble layout,
the `kvalues_iq4nl` table, no `-8`/`-16`) in `fattn-common.cuh`, the three CMake default lists, and - the
**one real latent bug** - the non-contiguous FA staging converter: `ggml_get_to_fp16_nc_cuda()` returned
`nullptr` for `iq4_nl` and `launch_fattn` called it, so any K/V *view* would have been a null-pointer
call.  Unreachable before (no FA path for the type), instant on the first `iq4_nl` backend-op case: the
very first `-o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` run **SIGSEGV'd in `launch_fattn<64,2,1>`**.  Fixed with
`dequantize_q4_nl` + all three NC switches.

**Gates** (final binary): `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5935/5935** (was 5599 - the 336 `iq4_nl` cases now run,
incl. mask/sink/alibi/softcap/permute/view variants), `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` **22/22** (two new cases at the
model's own geometry D=256 / gqa=12), `GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46; `W=1..8` pure on 4B (1 GPU, both `RS`),
27B (both splits), MoE, gemma-4-E4B and qwen4exp (both splits, default **and** QSA-forced); qwen4exp text
`plain == n_max 3 == n_max 7` = `acd18ad2d55c` (tensor) / `a38a6e2d8efa` (layer) with the f16/q4_1
controls unmoved; MTP `n_max 3` 0.52727 (pos-1 0.757) and 27B f16 0.82716; perplexity oracle qwen4exp
tensor `iq4_nl` sparse 6.5244 / dense 6.4930 (controls within +-0.006, `iq4_nl` +0.031).  The vec-family
helpers are NVIDIA-only code on AMD, so they were validated by **forcing** the chooser to VEC with a
temporary env-gated instrument: 5935/5935 again with 880 forced hits (the instrument was reverted before
landing).

**Two open items, both filed** (`TODO.md`): (a) qwen4exp prefill is ~8-12 % slower for `iq4_nl` than for
f16/`q4_0`/`q4_1` at pp8192+, growing with context, even though `q4_0` has the identical byte layout —
`rocprofv3` shows it is **not** this amendment's code (QSA `iq4_nl` 1318.5 ms vs `q4_0` 1335.8 ms, same
VGPR/LDS/occupancy; dequant kernels identical at 1.2 ms; the executed graph identical at 1010 nodes, 0
diff; the traced kernel sum *lower* for `iq4_nl`), so the follow-up targets the host/launch side (the
per-type indexer op counts and the dense/sparse topology-flip sync); (b) **Block 15's
`LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0` dense masked arm is broken for every KV type** (PPL ~1.05 vs the delivery's
6.49-6.55) — found by the 8th re-cut, pre-existing (the 7th re-cut reproduces it), not fixable by any
Block 15 gate, and a **promotion blocker** because that arm is this repo's quality oracle; the beta
records (`BETA-TESTING.md` §4c/§4d) now carry the evidence and add the oracle to the beta gate list.  The
re-cut also confirmed the beta's production path is byte-identical to the delivery (f16/q4_1 texts,
`iq4_nl` text, MTP acceptances, width purity, `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 22/22, `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` 5940/5940,
`LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1` PPL) apart from W2's ULP-level derived-bias sensitivity on `iq4_nl` (benign: identical
sparse-arm PPL).

## 2026-09-11 (9) — the QSA kernel gets an oracle, four more KV types, and a head-group fix (quality)

**Canonical tip `a0cd6ce02`** (block 14 amended a fourth time; block 13 `1a88c92f5`), net tree
`0966e66731a4c3da85ffd96525688865a89242cd`, 15 blocks, clean-apply strict 15/15 with 0 whitespace
warnings, applied tree == canonical, sim build clean and its coherence hash equal to the canonical
build's (`1c5d32ac537d`).  Delivery `main` carries the regenerated set (`rdna-boosts-all.patch`
21 750 lines) and the 7th block-15 beta re-cut (`8a0e2eb3f`, tree `764808b4c`, patch 3 774 lines).

**The task was "let the fused sparse QSA op read the quantized caches" — it turned into a correctness
finding.**  Two changes, one amendment:

* **Quantized KV for QSA.**  `q4_0`/`q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1` rows are now dequantized to F16 while a tile is
  staged (`get_dequantize_V<type_KV, half, 4>`, the idiom the vec FA kernel and the lightning indexer
  already use), with the four types threaded through the dispatch, `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_qsa_supported()`
  and `qsa_kv_native`.  Effect on 3x R9700 `-sm tensor`: `q4_1` prefill 2076.4 -> **2384.2 t/s at
  32 768** (dense masked reference 2078.1, f16 sparse 2380.9) — the quantized cache now tracks f16
  exactly, at pp8192 2404.1 (f16 2376.5) — i.e. the ~13.8 % long-context prefill the type used to lose
  is recovered, which was the measured prize that started this.
* **The head-group fix (the important half).**  A QSA block stages ONE K/V tile into shared memory and
  every warp reads it, so all of the block's q-heads must map to the same K/V head.  The chunking was
  `head_base += QSA_MAX_HEADS` (16) — and qwen4exp is 24 q-heads / 2 kv-heads = **gqa 12**, so a 16-warp
  block mixed heads 0..11 (kv 0) with 12..15 (kv 1) into the same smem rows (each staging thread adds
  its own head's K/V offset before the cooperative gather).  16 of 24 heads attended over the wrong V
  rows.  Now `min(QSA_MAX_HEADS, gqa_ratio)` heads per block (a no-op at gqa >= 16; for qwen4exp two
  blocks of 12).  Quality, measured as perplexity over 8 x 4096 tokens, 3-GPU `-sm layer`:
  **7.3269 +/- 0.151 -> 6.5267 +/- 0.132**, versus the dense masked oracle **6.5306 +/- 0.132** (the
  dense path computes the same top-k attention through the well-tested FA kernels).  The same table
  validates the new types (`q4_1` 6.5787 vs 6.5805 dense, `q5_0` 6.5444 vs 6.5375).

**It also fixed a hole in the test suite.**  `test-backend-ops` had **no** `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` coverage, and
the CPU reference (`ggml_compute_forward_flash_attn_qsa`) knew only f16/bf16/q8_0 — so the kernel that
serves qwen4exp's default attention path had *no oracle anywhere*.  This entry adds the four types to
the CPU reference and 18 `test_flash_attn_qsa` cases (all seven KV types; gqa 1 and 8; the three head
sizes; `n_tps` 1 and 4; sliced+combined top-k walks).  **0/18 -> 18/18**: the old kernel scores NMSE
~1.0 (i.e. it computes something else entirely), the fixed one < 5e-4.

**Why every earlier gate missed it** (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §21): the corruption is *width-uniform*, so the
`W=1..8` purity matrix — the instrument behind every previous QSA finding — is structurally blind to
it; the probe never even executed the op (the QSA op only exists above the indexer selection width
`indexer_top_k + r - 1` = 2051, and the probe's `n_ctx` is 2048, so its max `P` = 2040 — forcing the
selection path with `LLAMA_QSA_DENSE_SHORTCUT=0 LLAMA_QSA_DENSE_DECODE_UNTIL=0` is now part of the QSA
gate); and MTP acceptance pointed the *wrong way* (draft and main run the same wrong attention, so the
corrupted pair is self-consistent and accepts **more**: 0.65 vs 0.49).  The instruments that catch it
are the CPU oracle and the dense path as a reference — both now permanent.

**Validation** (all 3x R9700 gfx1201, canonical `a0cd6ce02`): `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 18/18, `FLASH_ATTN_EXT`
5599/5599, `GATED_DELTA_NET` 4/4; probe purity with the QSA op forced at every width, all seven types,
both splits (f16 tensor `f400a002bd0af7df` is **identical** for the pre-fix and fixed builds — the fix
is provably a no-op in the tensor split, where the kernel sees one K/V head per device: `Q.ne2=12,
K.ne2=1`; layer f16 `18bc218586c80f91` -> `9aef99f6a614de4c`; the four new types
layer `83b460071c92c4be`/`9e6035525c2e3f07`/`c5e332fed9aa1c18`/`a0bad36e46adaf57`, tensor
`85cd44e288fe6124`/`595721104be83ac1`/`524d2df8d1be0987`/`3b4a5b989b988134`, all `W=1..8` pure);
text purity (`/tmp/prompt3k.txt` = 2122 tokens, just over the selection width, so the sparse arm really
runs) tensor f16 `804de0576868` (**unchanged** = the recorded reference), layer f16 `95817e5d366a`,
tensor `q4_1` `886292b17a93`, layer `q4_1` `b15e1c98dbf8`, tensor `q4_0` `26065aab382c`, each
`plain == n_max 3 == n_max 7`; MTP `n_max 3` pos-1 acceptance 0.651 (layer `q4_1`, aggregate 0.402) /
0.771 (tensor `q4_1`) / 0.49 (layer f16) / 0.47009 (tensor f16, unchanged); prefill `-sm tensor`
p8192/16384/32768 f16 2376.5/2435.1/2380.9, `q4_1` 2404.1/2452.5/2384.2, dense 2493.0/2411.8/2079.9;
decode `-sm tensor` d0/8192/32768 tg128 f16 51.4/51.8/49.9 (dense-decode default) vs 51.1/47.6/44.7
(forced sparse) — **the arch decode policy was re-measured on the fixed kernel and stands** (dense wins
at every depth); non-QSA regression: 4B/27B probe hashes reproduce exactly and every non-QSA file is
untouched.

**Landing**: block 14 amended in place (`git commit --amend`, the delta byte-identical to the validated
working diff — it is the tip, so no rebase), `scripts/make-patches.sh` default tip -> `a0cd6ce02`,
`rdna-boosts-all.patch` refreshed by hand, clean-apply sim re-verified, block 15 re-cut a seventh time
(one real conflict in `src/models/qwen4exp.cpp`: block 15's refactored `qwen4exp_qsa_sparse()` needs the
extended type conjunct; `fattn-qsa.cu`/`ops.cpp`/`test-backend-ops.cpp` auto-merged), beta patch
re-exported (3 774 lines, subject `[PATCH 15/15]`, round-trip verified).

**Next session's task (F3 step 2, `iq4_nl`) has its brief**:
`archive/work/kv-quant-purity-followups/HANDOVER-2026-09-11-f3-step2-iq4_nl.md` — the same two-block shape
(block 08 for the dense FA enablement, block 14 for QSA + the CPU oracle + the test), with the measured
pre-state (`-ctk iq4_nl` on the 4B is 2269.8 pp512 / 48.5 tg32 today because FA is disabled for the
whole context) and the prize (`iq4_nl` is the smallest KV cache of the set: 288 MiB vs f16's 1024 at
c=32768 on the 4B).

**Also recorded**: `AGENTS.md` gained the "RDNA first, other backends uninjured" scope policy (the F1
VEC arms stay as they are — AMD can't reach them, NVIDIA has its own maintainers) and the QSA-oracle
critical fact; `patches/README.md` gained the fourth-amendment section; `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §21 records
the shared-staging-tile rule and the instrument analysis; `TODO.md` marks the task done and lists
`iq4_nl` (F3 step 2), the tensor-tuned prefill crossover knob and the QSA fused-op probe as follow-ups.

## 2026-09-11 (8) — F3 step 1: `q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1` become first-class KV cache types

**Canonical tip `6f07fe67a`** (block 08 `1a488fcf0`, block 14 `6f07fe67a`), net tree
`0c9dece6b0798e41360b8a8366187f38f37e1566`, 15 blocks, clean-apply strict 15/15 with 0 whitespace
warnings and the applied tree equal to the canonical one.  Two blocks amended: 08 (the FlashAttention
KV-type enablement) and 14 (the QSA-vs-KV-type arm + the tensor-split gate).

**Step 0 of the job was an instrument, not code.**  `--cache-type-k/v q4_1|q5_0|q5_1` were width-pure
and cheap (27B, ctx 204800: 1375/1512/1650 MiB vs 2337 `q8_0` / 4400 f16) but 3.4x slower prefill and
1.7x decode.  The `[FATPATH]`/`[FATTRACE]` trace settled the mechanism: f16/`q4_0`/`q8_0` take
`BEST_FATTN_KERNEL_TILE` at every width **with `need_f16_K/V = 1`** — i.e. the launcher stages f16
copies and the tile/mma families consume every type `ggml_get_to_fp16_cuda` covers — while `q4_1`
produced **no FA call at all**, because `ggml_cuda_fattn_kv_type_supported()` returned false and
`llama_context::resolve_fused_ops()`' FlashAttention probe then disabled FA for the whole context (the
non-FA attention path).  So the fix is not a new kernel: it is to let the FA path accept the types and
keep the vec family's instance list consistent.

**Block 08 (second 2026-09-11 amendment): the three types are enabled.**  `Q4_1`/`Q5_0`/`Q5_1` lose
their `#ifndef GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS` guard, the default vec dispatch gains the three diagonal cases,
and `ggml-{cuda,hip,musa}/CMakeLists.txt` gain the three diagonal instances (3 TUs).  `FA_ALL_QUANTS`
stays the knob for the 42 *mixed* `K != V` pairs; with it off the chooser still enforces `K == V`, so
the reachable pair set is exactly the diagonals and the predicate cannot disagree with the instances.
Measured (4B, 1 GPU, pp512/tg32): `q4_1` **2119.6/55.94 -> 7366.3/94.16** (+248 %/+68 %), on par with
`q4_0` (7376.0/93.9) and `q8_0` (7337.7/93.8); qwen4exp 3-GPU `-sm tensor` `q4_1` within 1 % of f16 at
every width (pp512 476.1, tg pl=1 40.60 / pl=4 126.44 / pl=8 176.16).

**Block 14 (third 2026-09-11 amendment): qwen4exp's QSA arm respects the KV type, and the tensor-split
gate is narrowed.**  Narrowing the gate alone was not enough — qwen4exp + a *quantized* KV cache +
`-sm tensor` **aborted** (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp:538`, `ret.axis != GGML_BACKEND_SPLIT_AXIS_UNKNOWN`)
— and it aborted for **`q4_0` too**, which the delivery's own gate allowed: this is a pre-existing bug,
not a consequence of the enablement.  Instrumented, the op with the unknown split state is
`MUL name=attn_gated-<il>`, whose sources are the (mirrored) attention output and the hidden-split
attention gate.  The graph built `GGML_OP_FLASH_ATTN_QSA` for a cache type the fused QSA kernel cannot
read (`ggml_cuda_flash_attn_qsa_supported()`: f16/bf16/q8_0 only), so the op was never split and the
split states stopped agreeing.  `LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1` and `LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0` both made it work; the fix
takes the dense masked path whenever the cache type is not QSA-native (`qsa_sparse` now also requires
f16/bf16/q8_0).  The tensor-split gate is narrowed to the types that really have a native FA read path
(`llama_kv_type_has_native_fa`, mirroring the backend predicate), which turns the pre-existing `q4_0`
abort into the clean error; the message lists the allowed set.  On dense models the newly enabled types
split fine (`27B` + `q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1` + 3-GPU `-sm tensor` validated), and on qwen4exp only the
*fused sparse* prefill arm is given up for quantized caches — the decode band was already dense there
by arch policy, so its logits are unchanged (the `q4_1` probe hash is identical with and without
`LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0`).

**Validation (gfx1201, per type).**  Width purity (probe, P=256, `W=1..8`, `CB=0`, `RS=0` and
`RS=from_w`) on 4B/1-GPU, 27B/`-sm layer`, 27B/`-sm tensor`, MoE-35B-A3B/1-GPU, gemma-4-E4B (SWA)/1-GPU
and qwen4exp/`-sm tensor`: **one hash per (model, split, RS)** for f16/`q4_0`/`q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1`/`q8_0`,
with every pre-existing value reproducing its recorded reference (`671d6096987470cb` 4B f16,
`31a0c1bace68e211` 4B q8_0, `619c151e48c76613` 4B q4_0, `4089b4d40b91090c` 27B layer f16,
`91434ea90f2cbfa0` 27B tensor f16, `d4156dbeb2252022` 27B tensor q8_0, `ac8825358d9adfda` MoE f16,
`dcf1ae667f730879` qwen4exp tensor f16).  Greedy purity: 27B and qwen4exp, `plain` ==
`--spec-draft-n-max 3` == `7` byte-identical for `q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1` (qwen4exp `q4_1`
`42dfe66f25ed`, qwen4exp `q8_0` control `75d8530c5bb1` = the recorded item-1 value, 27B `q5_0`
`baca8ae6b30e`, 27B `q5_1` `675a1aa57b90`).  MTP gate: qwen4exp `q4_1` pos-1 acceptance **0.628**
(`q8_0` 0.700) with 61.2 t/s vs plain 45.9; 27B `q4_1` **0.893** (`q8_0` 0.962) with 85.7 vs 36.9 t/s.
`test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **5599/5599** (up from 4591/4591 — the new pairs are now covered)
and `-o GATED_DELTA_NET` 4/4.  Coherence: 4B 3-GPU `-sm tensor` same-seed `1c5d32ac537d` on both the
canonical and the clean-apply sim build.  The block-15 beta patch was re-cut a sixth time on the new
tip (**base `6f07fe67a` -> beta commit `8c377b958`**, tree `34527a292`) — this re-cut is *not*
metadata-only: the merge threads the KV type into block 15's refactored `qwen4exp_qsa_sparse()` via new
`llama_cparams::type_k/type_v` fields, and it is a no-op for every validated beta config (f16/bf16/q8_0).

**Next (F3 step 2):** `iq4_nl` (same memory class as `q4_0`, but no V-side dequant at all in the FA
kernels — needs `dequantize_V_iq4_nl` + an instance + the vec/cross-product instance decision + the
same sweeps); see `archive/work/kv-quant-purity-followups/HANDOVER-2026-09-11-f3-kv-diagonals.md`.

## 2026-09-11 (7) — the QSA decode arm and the MoE shared-expert epilogue are band-uniform

**Canonical tip `5ad11fd35`** (block 13 `ee6b7d53d`, block 14 `5ad11fd35`), net tree
`3e7accbd7f46c3d196e168a4d29a0350f813f5ff`, 15 blocks, clean-apply strict 15/15 with 0 whitespace
warnings.  Two width-dependences of the same shape as the F1/F2/HC fixes — a band gate written as
`n_tokens == 1` — closed in one session, each in its owning block.

**Block 13 (fourth amendment) — the MoE shared-expert epilogue serves the band.**
`ggml_cuda_op_shexp_down_gate` (the fused `down(swiglu) * sigmoid(gate(x)) + moe_out + ffn_residual`)
was gated `down_mm->src[1]->ne[1] == 1 && gate_mm->src[1]->ne[1] == 1` *because* its fused gate
reduction does not reproduce the standalone mmvq order — so `W=1` ran the fused epilogue and `W>=2`
the unfused chain: the last width-impurity in the MoE class (`W=1 ac8825358d9adfda` vs
`W>=2 bd138ad2326fbbf2`, 35B-A3B Q4_K_M).  The kernels are now token-generic (`shexp_gate_sigmoid`:
one warp per token; `shexp_down_gated_q8_0`: one block per `(row, token)`) with **`nwarps` pinned to
the single-token value** (`calc_nwarps` returns 4 for `ncols_dst 1..4` but 2 for `5..8`, and `nwarps`
sets `blocks_per_iter` = the reduction order), and the fusion arm accepts
`1 <= ne[1] <= MMVQ_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (same width on both matmuls, contiguous epilogue operands).
Probe: `W = 1,2,3,4,8` all `ac8825358d9adfda`; kill-switch (`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SHEXP_DOWN_GATE=1`)
all `bd138ad2326fbbf2` (uniform unfused reference).  **MoE MTP improved**: 35B-A3B, 1 GPU, f16,
`n_max 3`, `n=96`: acceptance **0.81707** (was 0.51) with 167.3 t/s vs plain 96.9 (**+73 %**) — the
verify now uses the same epilogue arithmetic as the draft's single-token decode steps.  Cost: the
fused kernel re-reads the down weight row per token, so at the widest verify batches it loses a
little to the unfused chain (pl=8 332.1 vs 341.5, pl=4 252.0 vs 254.2); the decode win is kept
(pl=1 97.9 vs 98.3) and the fix (a column-blocked fused kernel that reads the weight row once per
`(row)` block) is a follow-up in `TODO.md`.  `patches/README.md` block-13 notes; `GREEDY-PURITY.md`
§17.

**Block 14 (second 2026-09-11 amendment) — the QSA decode arm serves the band.**  qwen4exp was still
not `plain == draft-mtp` in *text* (only ~100 of ~700 characters in common) even after the
hyper-connection band fix.  Localised to the QSA **indexer** arm choice: `LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1` is
byte-identical (`d4499ac8db72`) while `LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0` is not, so the sparse-FA kernel is
exonerated; the single-step width probe is pure (it cannot reach the bug: `P <= 2048` keeps `n_kv`
below the selection width).  An arm trace (`build_layer_attn`): the middle arm — the arch policy's
dense decode arm — was gated `n_tokens == 1`, and with `width = indexer_top_k + r - 1 = 2051`
(`n_kv = 2304` at the first decode graph) `--spec-type none` took **arm 2 (dense)** while
`draft-mtp` (`n_tokens=4`) fell through to **arm 3 (sparse top-k selection)**; identical for the first
11 graph builds, split at the first decode graph.  Fix: `QSA_DECODE_BAND = 8` (the `n_max <= 7` purity
band), arm 2 takes `n_tokens <= QSA_DECODE_BAND`; prefill keeps the sparse selection (the policy
"prefill is untouched: QSA always").  Measured: `plain == n_max 3 == n_max 7` = `804de0576868`
(f16 KV, 704 chars) and `plain == n_max 3` = `75d8530c5bb1` (q8_0 KV, 660 chars); MTP `n_max 3` pos-1
acceptance 0.615 with 63.9 t/s vs plain 50.1 (**+28 %**), `n_max 7` pos-1 0.618.  The plain stream
moves with the fix (658 -> 704 chars) — the shared 4-token non-decode shape at `n_kv = 2304` also
moves to the dense arm.  Cost: the verify is now dense, slightly more attention work than the top-k
selection when the cache has just crossed the budget (pl=5 146.7 vs 149.5, pl=6 160.1 vs 162.5,
pl=1/2/4/7/8 flat or better).  Two width-dependences remain in the **sparse** regime and are recorded
in `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §18 + `TODO.md`: the fused indexer score's "byte-identical" claim is measurably
false and is itself `n_tokens == 1`-gated (unreachable on gfx1201 by default, but the default path on
gfx1151 above its 64K crossover), and a residual split survives even with one arm (706-character
common prefix instead of 100, then divergence).

Full gate set: probes on both platforms, `plain`/`n_max 3`/`n_max 7` text purity on f16 + q8_0 KV,
MTP acceptance/throughput gates (MoE + qwen4exp), `llama-batched-bench` pl=1..8 on both models,
`test-backend-ops -o GATED_DELTA_NET` and `-o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` (4/4 backends), 4B coherence smoke.
The block-15 beta patch was re-cut on the new tip on the new tip: base `5ad11fd35` -> beta commit `f3ece1e123905a98059025a7e7a3c7e8e28f54dc`, tree `5316920f130e585e23b9a38eef6e2c3c5940259e` (the `qwen4exp.cpp` hunk headers shift by +9 lines; `git am -3`/`git apply -3` resolves it cleanly, a plain `git am` does not).

## 2026-09-11 (6) — cause 3 localised: qwen4exp's plain-vs-spec gap is the QSA indexer path (not the FA kernel)

Follow-up measurement on the cause-3 item of entry (5).  All three runs are qwen4exp, 3-GPU
`-sm tensor`, f16 KV, `/tmp/prompt3k.txt` (~3.3k prompt), 128 greedy tokens, `--temp 0 --seed 42`,
`n_max 3` where applicable; the emitted text is extracted by backspace-stripping and hashing the
generation between the `> ` prompt echo and the `[ Prompt: ... ]` footer.

| run | plain (`--spec-type none`) | `draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3` |
|---|---|---|
| default | `3ee9daee5c07` (658 chars) | `8a50ea24e8d5` (729) |
| `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0` | `dad4f4442580` (721) | `9d29b773906f` (665) |
| **`LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1`** | **`d4499ac8db72` (711)** | **`d4499ac8db72` (711)** — identical |
| `LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0` | `25f300a81b9e` (723) | `0d466b2dcf09` (721) |

* **The kill-switch that works is `LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1`**: plain == `draft-mtp` byte-identical, and the
  knob provably fires (the plain text moves `3ee9daee5c07` -> `d4499ac8db72`).
* **`LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0` does *not* fix it** (two different texts, both moved — so the knob fired):
  the sparse-FA kernel (`fattn-qsa.cu`) is therefore **exonerated**, and the defect is in the rest of
  the QSA machinery — the **indexer/score** path (`indexer-topk.cu` plus the `qwen4exp.cpp` gates).
  `LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1`'s own comment says it "forces the dense no-indexer regime everywhere", which is
  exactly the part `LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0` keeps.
* **The site class is cause 1's**: `src/models/qwen4exp.cpp:1094` gates the fused indexer score on
  `idx_score_fused && idx_key_float && n_tokens == 1 && ...` and `:1419` gates the early-decode dense
  shortcut on `qsa_dense_decode_until > 0 && n_tokens == 1 && n_kv < qsa_dense_decode_until` — so a
  1-token decode and an n-token verify batch take different QSA paths.  The single-step width probe is
  pure because it never reaches the sparse/indexer decode regime (its one decode step sits in the
  dense window).
* **It is not a prefill-state difference**: the divergence appears only after ~100 chars (~20 generated
  tokens) of the 3.3k-prompt run, i.e. the first steps agree (and `n_max 3` == `n_max 7` text is
  **identical** — `8a50ea24e8d5` — which is the cause-2 fix's win, since pre-fix they disagreed:
  `8a50ea24e8d5` vs `e6918a7af1f9`).
* The known **Issue #25 GDN chunked-prefill** item is a *separate* contributor, not this one: its
  kill-switch moves both texts (`3ee9daee5c07` -> `dad4f4442580`, `8a50ea24e8d5` -> `9d29b773906f`)
  without making them agree.  So cause 3 is **not** the GDN item and closing the GDN item will not
  close qwen4exp's plain-vs-spec gap.

**Consequence for the backlog:** cause 3 is a *small, well-scoped* fix in the established F2-cause-1
pattern (make the QSA decode band take one path for `n_tokens = 1..8`), with two identified sites and a
proven kill-switch — **not** a deep kernel issue.  Until it lands, `LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1` restores
`plain == draft-mtp` for qwen4exp byte-identically.

## 2026-09-11 (5) — F2 cause 2 FIXED: the MoE decode/verify band is band-uniform (block-13 amendment)

**qwen4exp is now width-pure `W = 1..8`**, so the designed `--spec-draft-n-max <= 7` verify batch is
bit-identical to the 1-token decode — the remaining *logit-level* condition for `plain == draft-mtp`.
Canonical tip **`bfaa83d8a`**, net tree **`4e5f2952f016f1ac160c53261f7b01d346322534`**; only
`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/mmvq.cu` changed (26 insertions / 11 deletions).

**Task 1 answered by measurement, and it moved the diagnosis.**  `[GD]` full-graph dumps show the graphs
are **identical** at every stage (2647/2404/2271/1863/1668/1565 nodes at both `W=4` and `W=5`), so the
previous entry's question ("fusion-applied vs graph-built-with-fewer-ops") is settled: the graph always
contains `MUL_MAT_ID(ffn_moe_gate)`, `MUL_MAT_ID(ffn_moe_up)`, `GLU(ffn_moe_swiglu)` at the same node
indices (`k=76/77/78`), and only the *fusion coverage* differs.  But the cause was **not** the
`mul_mat_id_glu_ops` fusion the previous entry blamed:

* `mul_mat_vec_q_moe`'s `__launch_bounds__` was `get_mmvq_mmid_max_batch_for_device<type>()*warp_size`
  — the upstream **per-type mmvq cap compiled into the kernel**, while the block is
  `(warp_size, ncols_dst)`.  Launching `IQ3_S` (cap 4) with `ncols_dst = 5` is 160 threads > the bound
  and dies with `ROCm error: unspecified launch failure`, so the cap is a *capability* limit, not just
  a heuristic.
* the same cap routes the upper band to MMQ: `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_id` takes `ne2 <= cap → mmvq` else
  `should_use_mmq → MMQ`, and `use_mmvq` (`ggml-cuda.cu:3730`) gates the `mul_mat_q_pair` fusion
  (which is what actually fired at `W = 5..7`).  mmvq (one warp per token, `mul_mat_vec_q_moe`) and
  MMQ reduce in different orders, so the band splits.
* the **UD-IQ4_XS quant mixes expert types per layer** — 47 layers `IQ3_S` gate/up (cap 4), layer 2
  `IQ4_XS` (cap 5), down `IQ4_NL`/`Q8_0` (cap 7) — which *predicts the census exactly*: fused layers
  48/48/48/48/1/0/0/0 for `W = 1..8` (measured `ffn_moe_up` MUL_MAT_ID counts 0/0/0/0/47/48/48).  That
  is the 4→5 and 5→6 boundary; the down's cap 7 is the 7→8 boundary.

**Fix.**  Block 13 already carries the invariant — `mul_mat_vec_q_switch_ncols_dst`'s `has_ids` branch
("this must cover `ncols_dst == 1` as well … the decode == verify invariant", added by block 13
2026-09-01) routes every `MUL_MAT_ID` to the column-generic MoE kernel.  The fix completes it for the
whole band:

1. `mmvq_mmid_max_batch_band(cap)` floors the per-type cap at `MMVQ_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (the decode/verify
   band), applied to every AMD arch lookup, host *and* device;
2. `mul_mat_vec_q_moe`'s launch bound becomes `MMVQ_MAX_BATCH_SIZE*warp_size`, so the kernel can
   actually be launched across the band.

No other path changes: the caps' call sites are all `MUL_MAT_ID`-only, so dense models are untouched.

**Validation.**  `W = 1..8` all `3adeb313042a871b` (`-sm layer`) and `dcf1ae667f730879`
(`-sm tensor`) — i.e. every width equals that split's **pre-fix `W = 1` value**, so plain decode is
bit-unchanged and only `W = 5..8` moved onto it (the F1 "move the cheap side" pattern).  Also pure with
the state-sequence dimension exercised (`RS=0` and `RS=from_w`).  Controls: the **pre-fix vs post-fix
`plain` text is byte-identical** (`3ee9daee5c07`), and at the MTP gate config (`n_max 3` = `W=4`, a
no-op width) the runs are byte-identical: acceptance `0.76744` (66/86), generation 80.1 vs 80.0 t/s.
Text level: pre-fix `n_max 3` ≠ `n_max 7`; **with the fix they agree** (`8a50ea24e8d5`).

**Perf — the fix is a large win at the verify widths** (`llama-batched-bench`, fixed vs baseline
interleaved, swappable `libggml-hip.so`):

| model | batch 1 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| qwen4exp 3-GPU `-sm tensor` tg128 | 50.5 / 50.4 | 85.4 / 85.6 | 134.1 / 132.9 | **149.5 / 118.4 (+26 %)** | **162.5 / 130.6 (+24 %)** | **171.4 / 147.0 (+17 %)** | **178.0 / 155.4 (+14.5 %)** |
| 35B-A3B MoE 1 GPU tg128 | 98.3 / 98.1 | 156.4 / 156.2 | 254.2 / 254.1 | – | – | – | **341.3 / 289.9 (+17.8 %)** |
| 4B dense 1 GPU tg128 | 100.6 / 100.5 | 167.2 / 167.3 | 294.0 / 294.9 | – | – | – | 414.5 / 413.3 |

Widths inside the caps are unchanged (and bit-identical), dense is untouched, and MTP `n_max 7` goes
**41.8–42.5 vs 36.1 t/s (+16–18 %)** with acceptance `0.59375` vs `0.55556`.  The upstream per-type
mmvq caps were actively *costing* throughput on RDNA4 with the fork's mmvq + fused-GLU kernels.

**Cross-checks.**  `GATED_DELTA_NET` 4/4 backends OK; `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` 4/4 OK; MoE asterisk intact
(`ac8825358d9adfda` / `bd138ad2326fbbf2`); reserves unchanged (no allocation changes); clean-apply
simulation strict 15/15 with **0 whitespace warnings** and tree == canonical.

**Open — cause 3 (new, pre-existing, independent of cause 2).**  `plain` still differs from
`draft-mtp` text for qwen4exp even after the fix (`plain` `3ee9daee5c07` vs `n_max 3 == n_max 7`
`8a50ea24e8d5`), and the fix **cannot** be responsible: `n_max 3` uses `W = 4`, where the fix is a
verified no-op (bit-identical logits, byte-identical text, byte-identical acceptance).  Since the
single-step probe shows bit-identical logits for `W = 1..8` across both splits and the state-sequence
dimension, the divergence must be a **multi-step** effect — i.e. the speculative roll-back itself.
Prime suspect: the **masked (freed/stale) KV cells** written by rejected drafts, which block 14 keeps
at exactly `+0.0` in the HIP `fattn-tile`/`fattn-mma-f16` and Vulkan paths but **not** in qwen4exp's
**QSA sparse-attention path** (`fattn-qsa.cu`).  Next instrument: a multi-step probe (prefill P, then
feed a *fixed* token sequence, comparing the logits at each position between `W = 1` steps and `W = k`
chunks) — the single-step probe and `RS` dimension cannot see a cell that is only stale after a
roll-back.  **Corrected in the 2026-09-11 (6) entry: the cause-3 site is the QSA *indexer* machinery,
not the sparse-FA kernel, and the proven kill-switch is `LLAMA_QSA_OFF=1`.**

## 2026-09-11 (4) — F2 cause 2 localised: it is the MoE gate+up+GLU fusion flipping at `n_q = 5`, not a kernel-dispatch band

**Instrument.**  The per-node `[ND]` dump (`GGML_CUDA_NODE_DUMP=1`, re-appliable from
`archive/work/kv-quant-purity-followups/tools/node-dump-instrumentation.patch`) on qwen4exp, `-sm layer`,
P=256, RS=0, at W=4/5/6/7.

**Result — the executed-op census is the signature, and it is unambiguous:** only one op's count changes
across the whole band, and it changes at exactly the boundary:

| width | `ffn_moe_down` | `ffn_moe_up` | total nodes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `W=1..4` | 48 | **0** | 1920 |
| `W=5`   | 48 | **47** | 1967 |
| `W=6,7` | 48 | **48** | 1968 |

So the MoE **gate+up+GLU fusion** (`mul_mat_id_glu_ops = {MUL_MAT_ID, MUL_MAT_ID, GLU}`,
`ggml-cuda.cu:3324`, admitted via `ggml_cuda_should_fuse_mul_mat`) is applied for `n_q <= 4` and
abandoned from `n_q = 5`, and the fused GLU epilogue and the separate `MUL_MAT_ID` + `GLU` chain do not
sum identically — which is the impurity.  The `W=6`/`W=7` pair is a **perfect calibration** (`+0` nodes,
`0` differing ops) — that is *why* they hash identically, and it validates the census (the previous
session's node-dump diff was unusable because it had no such calibration, and because shape equality is
not sufficient: cache/state tensors legitimately differ with W).

**Refuted by measurement (the pre-HC-fix exclusion list was unreliable — the `W=1` vs `W>=2` break
dominated those hashes):** the block-13 `get_mmvq_mmid_max_batch` cap and its MMQ pair arm (forcing MMVQ
across the band via a temporary `GGML_CUDA_MOE_MMVQ_BAND=1` is **byte-identical**, and `should_use_mmq`
is false for `n_q <= 8`, so that arm never fires in the band); the MoE expert kernel (`mul_mat_vec_q_moe`
is **provably width-invariant** — `rpb` derives from `blocks_per_row_x`, a K property, and
`block_dims = (warp_size, ncols_dst)` is one warp per token); `LLAMA_QSA_OFF`,
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_GRAPHS`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MOE_MMQ_FUSION`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_WEIGHTED_DOWN`,
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SHEXP_DOWN_GATE` (all leave `W=5` = `c999233926f0`; positive control
`LLAMA_FUSED_HC_MIX=0 LLAMA_FUSED_HC_COMBINE=0` -> `bdaa8fc57381`, the recorded HC-off value, proving the
env plumbing); `ggml_cuda_should_use_mmvf(F32)` on gfx1201 = `ne11 <= 3` (a 3/4 boundary that does not
appear).

**Consequence for the brief:** cause 2 is a **fusion-coverage** band, not an `ncols_dst`/`ne11`
kernel-dispatch band — so it is *not* the same workstream as F3, and the fix is the F1/HC shape: keep the
gate+up+GLU fusion for the whole decode/verify band (`n_q <= 8`) rather than only `n_q <= 4`, measuring
the verify-throughput cost the way F1's was.  Next step: re-run the `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_FUSION=1` width
matrix **post-HC-fix** (the earlier "survives all fusions disabled" observation predates it) to confirm
the unfused path is itself width-invariant.  Debug tooling to reuse: the node census above (nothing is
committed as code — it is the existing `[ND]` dump plus 30 lines of parsing), and the
`W=6` vs `W=7` calibration trick.

## 2026-09-11 (3) — Block 08 amended: the decode/verify band no longer spans two FlashAttention kernel families (F1 fixed)

**What changed.**  `ggml_cuda_get_best_fattn_kernel()` (`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn.cu`) no longer returns
`BEST_FATTN_KERNEL_VEC` for small batches.  The fallback was upstream code (`11f0af550`, "for small
batch sizes the vector kernel may be preferable"): VEC for `n_q == 1` when `!gqa_opt_applies`, and for
`n_q <= 2` whenever K or V is quantized.  Both conditions are *always* inside the `n_q <= 8`
decode/verify band (prefill fell through to TILE anyway), so the branch only ever split the band; it is
deleted and the whole band uses TILE — the same shape of fix as the block-08 WMMA guard added
2026-08-29 (`Q->ne[1] > 8`) and block 00's `ntiles_dst_eff` in `launch_fattn`.

**Why.**  Measured with a new `GGML_CUDA_FA_TRACE` instrumentation (committed for reuse as
`archive/work/kv-quant-purity-followups/tools/fa-kernel-chooser-trace.patch`): with `q8_0` or `q4_0` K/V the
chooser returned **VEC (100) at `n_q = 1,2` and TILE (200) at `n_q >= 3`**; the two families order the
online-softmax/PV reduction differently, so token-0 logits at `W = 1,2` disagreed with every verify
width.  The launcher's own plan was *already* width-independent (`ntiles_dst_eff`, `parallel_blocks`
== `ntiles_KV` at every width), which is why the earlier F1 suspects (KV-type staging, the KV-cache
write path, `stream_k` rounding) all measured clean.

**Measured (3x gfx1201, ROCm 7.14, unpinned).**
- 4B Q8_0 `q8_0/q8_0` **1 GPU `W=1..8` all `31a0c1bace68`**, 2-GPU `-sm tensor` `abebfb93`, 3-GPU
  `-sm tensor` `7fe106f5`; `q4_0/q4_0` `619c151e48c7` / `240bc37d` / `483a850e` — all four split
  configs pure, and every value is that config's *previous verify* value (only `W=1,2` moved).
- 27B Q8_0 `q8_0/q8_0` 3-GPU tensor `W = 1,2,3,4,5,8` all `d4156dbeb225`.
- f16/bf16 configs byte-identical (they never took VEC): 4B f16 `671d60969874`, bf16 `b5d7e7b4`.
- text level, 27B 3-GPU tensor, ctx 8192, 300 greedy tokens, `q8_0` KV: plain == `n_max 3` ==
  `n_max 7` = `3537bc2b36be` (before: plain `73b2565bce47`/2810 chars vs verify `3537bc2b36be`/2801);
  f16 control `f32aac948600` for both.  **Harness note:** `llama-cli`'s `/\|` spinner is ``-based and
  timing-dependent and the banner embeds the build SHA — apply backspaces and strip both before
  hashing; three "divergences" this session were spinner noise.
- MTP: 27B `n=96` q8_0 KV acceptance **0.90789 (69/76), identical** to the pre-fix build.  MoE
  asterisk unchanged (`ac8825358d9adfda` / `bd138ad2326fbbf2`, and both `bd138ad2326fbbf2` with
  `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SHEXP_DOWN_GATE=1`).
- perf (llama-bench, q8_0 KV, interleaved, same binary): 4B pp512 7609.8 -> 7597.9 (-0.15% = noise),
  tg128 98.03 -> 97.11 (**-0.9%**); 27B 3-GPU tensor pp512 2257.3 -> 2253.2 (-0.2%), tg128 38.46 ->
  38.28 (**-0.5%**).  Reserves byte-identical (27B ub2048 q8_0: dev 1920.3284 / host 880.3360).
- op suites **with the fix active**: `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **4591/4591, 4/4 backends**;
  `-o GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46, 2/2.  Quantized-KV coherence (the only configs that move) —
  gemma-4-E4B / 27B / qwen4exp with q8_0 KV: deterministic across runs and coherent.
- clean-apply: fresh `9113cc188` + `scripts/apply-all.sh` -> strict **15/15 `git am`**, **0 whitespace
  warnings**, applied tree == **`4104e7d34dd8cf9cb5488d46dcbba1b17eaa32d3`**.
- block-15 beta re-cut against the new base: **`0c8099ca2`**, tree **`7335b923d`** — metadata/offset
  only, 0 changed body lines (block 15's `fattn.cu` hunks sit at lines 166-326, the fix at ~690).

**New canonical tip `1bcf4e82d`**, tree `4104e7d34` (block 08 = `38cffdece`; blocks 09-14 got new SHAs,
bodies metadata-only — 2 lines each).  `rdna-boosts-all.patch` refreshed (95 files).

**This is NOT F2 cause 2.**  qwen4exp's `W >= 5` residual (`{1..4} {5} {6,7} {8}`) is **completely
unchanged** by this fix (W=1,4 `3adeb313042a`, W=5 `c999233926f0`, W=8 `c56ebb61963a`), which
**refutes the "F1 and F2 cause 2 share a cause" hypothesis** — cause 2 is not the kernel-family
chooser (it is a matmul/MoE dispatch band, still open).

**F3 refinement.**  The "slow pure" KV types are not missing a native kernel: they are rejected by
`ggml_cuda_fattn_kv_type_supported()` unless the build sets **`GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS`** (this build:
OFF), so `ggml_cuda_get_best_fattn_kernel()` returns `NONE` *before* the VEC/TILE choice (0 `[FATPATH]`
lines for `q4_1` vs 1+ for `q8_0`) and the attention takes the generic fallback — width-invariant by
construction (hence pure) and ~3.4x slower.  F3's first experiment is therefore a build-flag A/B.

## 2026-09-11 (2) — Block 14 amended: the fused hyper-connection ops serve the decode/verify band (qwen4exp width purity, cause 1 of 2)

**What changed.**  `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/hc-mix.cu` (`ggml_cuda_op_hc_mix`, `ggml_cuda_op_hc_combine`) and
the two graph gates in `src/models/qwen4exp.cpp` no longer require `nt == 1`: the fused
hyper-connection (HC) chain now serves the whole **decode/verify band `1 <= nt <= 8`**
(`HC_FUSED_MAX_TOKENS`, asserted in both ops).  The four mix kernels and the combine kernel take the
token index from `blockIdx.y` and offset every per-token pointer with the tensor's own stride
(`inject` is read with its view stride); at `nt == 1` every added term is zero, so the decode result is
unchanged (verified byte-identical for f16/bf16/q8_0/q4_0).  A `<= 8`-token **prefill** chunk also takes
the fused path — it cannot be told apart from a verify batch, and both must use the decode arithmetic;
wider chunks keep the unfused chain.  The ops are otherwise the same arithmetic, so no kernel numerics
were touched (the env fallback `LLAMA_FUSED_HC_MIX=0 LLAMA_FUSED_HC_COMBINE=0` reproduces the pre-fix
adaptive-MTP numbers exactly).

**Why.**  qwen4exp failed the decode==verify invariant ("F2"): a 1-token decode used the fused HC ops
while an n-token verify batch used the unfused chain, so the two computed the same position differently
and plain decode and `draft-mtp` disagreed.  Root-caused 2026-09-11 into **two stacked causes** (the
second is a `W >= 5` kernel-dispatch band shared with F1); this lands **cause 1**, as a block-14
amendment (block 14 introduced `hc-mix.cu` and the qwen4exp HC paths, so it owns them — the same
owner-based rule used for the block-02/12/13 amendments, not block 00).

**Measured** (3x gfx1201, ROCm `/opt/rocm-7.14-gfx1201`, unpinned):
- width probe, qwen4exp IQ4_XS f16 KV P=256 RS=0: `-sm layer` W=1..4 all **`3adeb313042a871b`** (was
  W=1 `3adeb313042a` + W=2..4 `044715b66e72f077`), `-sm tensor` W=1..4 all **`dcf1ae667f730879`**;
  **W=1 byte-identical to the pre-fix build on both splits and for every KV type** (f16
  `3adeb313042a`, bf16 `42e1bcfa57c1`, q8_0 `cb018394fd37`, q4_0 `688835658f30`).
- W=5 `c999233926f0` / W=6,7 `a8c532e12f9c` / W=8 `c56ebb61963a` (`-sm layer`) still grouped = **cause 2**,
  the `ncols_dst`/`ne11` selection band at `W >= 5`, shared with the `q8_0`/`q4_0` KV impurity (F1).
- greedy text: plain == `--spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3`, byte-identical (3275 chars);
  `n_max 7` still differs (cause 2).  qwen4exp is therefore width-pure for **`n_max <= 3`**.
- adaptive-MTP (f16 KV, n=96): acceptance **0.50000 -> 0.76744**, MTP generation **63.3 -> 79.9 t/s**.
  With a `q8_0` KV cache: 0.50000 -> 0.43089 — that configuration is already width-impure via F1 (its
  W=1 decode is also unchanged), so it must be re-measured once F1 is fixed; recorded, not gated.
- perf: `-sm tensor` f16 pp512 1288-1300 (**parity**), tg128 48.30/48.72 (**decode unchanged** vs the
  pre-fix build, and the fusion's +14% over the unfused fallback 42.28/42.32 is kept).
- no regressions: 27B 1 GPU W=1/W=8 `4089b4d4`, W=9 `72af52db`; MoE W1 `ac8825358d9adfda` / W3
  `bd138ad2326fbbf2`; reserves byte-identical (qwen4exp ub2048 q8_0 dev 6690.3987 / host 1262.6954 /
  kvbuf 956.26; f16 6642.1331 / 1262.4297 / 1800.00); `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` and
  `-o GATED_DELTA_NET` both 4/4 OK; `llama-batched-bench` B=1..8 clean.
- clean-apply: fresh `9113cc188` + `scripts/apply-all.sh` -> strict **15/15 `git am`**, **0 whitespace
  warnings**, applied tree == canonical **`e36263da57b8985cb98018af59fe639be0290dc4`**.
- the block-15 beta patch was re-cut against the new base (**beta tip `54859fdda`**, tree
  **`543ccc015`**, parent `1d8f53594`): metadata/offset-only, **0 changed body lines**.

**New canonical tip `1d8f53594`**, tree `e36263da5`.  Blocks 00-13 are byte-identical to the previous
regeneration; only `patches/0014-…` changed (the `From`/`index`/hunk-offset metadata plus the band fix).

**Follow-ups.**  Cause 2 (`W >= 5`) — fix together with F1/F3 (`archive/work/kv-quant-purity-followups/`);
the HC ops have no `test-backend-ops` coverage (a CUDA-vs-CPU band test would close that gap).

- **Block 15 beta revalidation (2026-09-11): re-cut against the current 15-patch delivery + full re-validation.**
  The Block-15 beta patch was cut on `b425aa8f7` (block 14 of the old **14-block** chain, block 13
  `e61676292`) — before block 00 existed and before the 2026-09-11 block-02/12/13 amendments — so it
  was re-cut against the current delivery (base `389c5341f`, tree `928852cdc`) and re-validated end to
  end.  Block 15 is still **staged in `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/`, NOT a delivery patch**; this is a
  beta-record update, not a delivery change (no `patches/` file and no block SHA moved).

  - **Re-cut**: new beta tip **`fe4f55278`** (tree `ffe197e2f`, parent `389c5341f`); the patch in the
    beta directory was replaced.  Measured dependency delta: **exactly one file** —
    `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn-common.cuh` `7442bc22a` → `22eec7d57`, i.e. block 00's
    `ntiles_dst_eff` fix inside `launch_fattn`; the other 22 touched files are byte-identical to the
    cut base, so the re-cut changes only the `From` line, that one `index` line and one `@@` hunk
    header (+8 offset).
  - **Numbering correction**: the first draft of the revalidation plan claimed the beta patch had to be
    renumbered `[PATCH 15/15]` → `[PATCH 16/16]`.  That was **wrong**: `make-patches.sh` uses
    `git format-patch --start-number 0`, so the denominator is the *last block index* — the delivered
    15-patch set is `[PATCH 00/14]`…`[PATCH 14/14]` and block 15 is correctly `[PATCH 15/15]`.
    Verified by regenerating the 16-commit range with the same convention: all 15 delivery patch
    *bodies* byte-identical, block 15 emitted as `[PATCH 15/15]`.
  - **Clean-apply**: fresh `9113cc188` + `scripts/apply-all.sh` → strict **15/15**, **0 whitespace
    warnings**, tree `928852cdc`; + the re-cut block-15 patch → 16 commits, tree `ffe197e2f`.
  - **Result: every 2026-09-10 Block-15 claim reproduced.**  Reserves to the last decimal (27B
    `1920.3284/880.3360` → `1121.1252/81.1329`; 4B `1800.3284/840.3360` → `1001.1252/41.1329` →
    `257.1252/41.1329`; gemma-4-E4B/E4B-31B and the qwen4exp W1/W2/W3 chain incl. indexer KV
    `956.26` → `318.76` and the bf16/V5 table with bf16+V5 costing exactly f16); the 27B width-purity
    probe hashes **identical to the delivered reference** (`4089b4d4` / `a4817ee6` / `91434ea9`,
    `W=9` `72af52db`/`b059daa6`/`bc3faabd`) so `n_max <= 7` holds and block 15 changes no FA numerics;
    V4/V5 on == off **bit-identically** (the flagged `launch_fattn` risk is cleared); same-seed output
    byte-identical across gates on 4B/27B (short + 40k)/both SWA gemmas/qwen4exp; MoE asterisk intact
    (`ac8825358d9adfda`/`bd138ad2326fbbf2`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SHEXP_DOWN_GATE=1` → both
    `bd138ad2326fbbf2`); MTP 27B `0.90789` and MoE `0.58378` identical on both builds; op suites
    `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **7859/7859 ROCm0 + 7859/7859 CPU** (6 derived), `GATED_DELTA_NET` OK,
    `test-alloc`/`test-batch-alloc` clean, W4 round trip 16.00 → 56.00 → 16.00 MiB; cost inside the
    documented envelope (4B prefill V3 −1.6 % / V4 −1.75 %, 27B V3 −0.3 %, decode flat; vs the
    delivery build 27B pp512 −1.7 % / tg128 flat, MoE pp512 −0.3 % / tg128 −1.25 %).  gfx1151 was
    **not** re-run (no such hardware on this host).
  - **Three PRE-EXISTING findings (not Block-15 regressions — identical hashes on the delivery build),
    now tracked in `archive/work/kv-quant-purity-followups/` + `TODO.md` + `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §12:** (F1) a
    **q8_0 or q4_0 K/V cache breaks the dense `n_max <= 7` purity guarantee** (`W=1 == W=2` then
    `W=3..8`; text-level plain `8ed58aa9` vs spec `da56855b` on the 27B) — the impure set is exactly
    the two types with a fast native both-quantized FA path; (F2) qwen4exp's fused sparse QSA path is
    not width-invariant; (F3) the sub-`q8_0` quants (q4_1/q5_0/q5_1/iq4_nl) are pure and 1800–2400 MiB
    but ~3.4x slower because they have no native FA path.  **Policy decided (maintainer
    2026-09-11): differing K/V cache types are rejected as an accepted limitation** (mixed pairs are
    1.7–3.6x slower than the same-type equivalent and never smaller; upstream #25871 already enforces
    same-K/V for DeepSeek V4).
  - Records updated: `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/{README,HANDOVER,BETA-TESTING}.md`,
    `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §12, `TODO.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `archive/work/kv-quant-purity-followups/`.

- **Block 13 amendment (2026-09-11, second): MoE `MUL_MAT_ID` decode/verify dispatch fix + the shared-expert fusion kill-switch.**
  Root-causes and closes the qwen35moe batch-width residual
  (`archive/work/sm-tensor-plain-vs-spec/FOLLOWUPS-2026-09-11.md` Part 2).  The residual was
  **not** in the MoE expert GEMM kernels.  A per-node, stride-aware dump of the
  decode graph that also covers fused-window destinations localised the first
  divergence to the **fused shared-expert window**
  (`ggml_cuda_op_shexp_down_gate`, gated `// decode only` on `ne[1] == 1`).  Two
  independent causes, both in that region:

  1. **`MUL_MAT_ID` never used the dedicated MoE kernel at `ncols_dst == 1`.**
     `mul_mat_vec_q_switch_ncols_dst` returned early only for `has_ids &&
     ncols_dst > 1`, so a single-token `MUL_MAT_ID` fell through to the **dense
     ksplit kernel with an ids gather** while a multi-token verify batch ran
     `mul_mat_vec_q_moe` -- two kernels, two accumulation orders, so a 1-token
     decode and an n-token verify batch of the same MoE matmul were not
     bit-identical.  The dense half of this was fixed earlier the same day (dense
     `MUL_MAT` rows always ksplit); the MMID half was still open
     ("`MUL_MAT_ID`/MoE keeps the item-split").  **Fixed**: route all `MUL_MAT_ID`
     through the MoE kernel -- it is column-generic (one warp per token column;
     `n_groups` and `warp_reduce_sum` depend only on `warp_size`), so decode and
     verify now share one path.  **+6.2% MoE decode** (tg128 95.62 -> 101.52),
     +1.4% pp512 (4790.6 -> 4858.6); dense 27B flat (tg128 31.95 -> 32.00,
     pp512 2021.9 -> 2033.5).
  2. **The fused shared-expert epilogue is not bit-exact with the unfused chain**:
     its gate dot uses `shexp_gate_sigmoid`'s own reduction order (not the
     standalone mmvq order), and its epilogue multiply was contracted into an FMA.
     The FMA is now removed (`__fmul_rn`, one rounding, matching the separate MUL
     kernel) -- necessary but not sufficient while the gate reduction differs.
     Making the whole window bit-exact needs the gate dot to reproduce
     `mul_mat_vec_q`'s order; scoped as future work.  The fusion is worth **+3.1%
     MoE decode** (101.5 vs 98.5 t/s), so it stays ON by default behind a
     first-class kill-switch: **`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SHEXP_DOWN_GATE=1`**.

  Verified: with the kill-switch set (plus fix 1) qwen35moe decode is
  **bit-identical** to the verify batch (`bd138ad2` both -- the W=3 value, so the
  decode path moves and the reference is preserved); by default both hashes are
  unchanged from the previous tip (no regression).  MoE MTP gate unchanged
  (acceptance 0.58378 = the canonical baseline exactly; per-pos 0.785/0.575/0.382;
  draft 130.9 vs plain 91.6 t/s).  Dense gates unchanged (`none == n_max 3 ==
  n_max 7` = `13acc229`; `n_max 8` still divergent = cause B).
  `test-backend-ops -o GATED_DELTA_NET` 2/2 OK.
  **Accepted residual**: by default the MoE decode/verify pair is still not
  byte-identical -- MoE is exempt from that gate by
  `benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md` rule 3, and the gate it *is* held to
  passes.  Canonical chain re-cut: block 13 `c43beca1b` -> `855515420`, block 14
  `daf32f804` -> `389c5341f`, tip **`389c5341f`**, net tree **`928852cdc`**;
  clean-apply strict 15/15 `git am`, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree ==
  canonical.  All temporary instrumentation reverted.

- **Correction: `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=nccl` was never a bit-identical reference under `-sm tensor` (2026-09-11).**
  Several docs used "hybrid vs RCCL coherence IDENTICAL" as a validation gate
  (`AGENTS.md`'s verify recipe, `patches/README.md` block-13 note, `RUN.md`).
  It does not hold: the internal AR pipeline always BF16-round-trips
  (`GGML_CUDA_AR_BF16_THRESHOLD` defaults to 1) while the NCCL path reduces
  *small* tensors in FP32 ("Reduces as FP32 for small tensors and BF16 for
  large", `allreduce.cu`), so the two backends differ by design.  Measured
  2-GPU `-sm tensor`, 27B Q8_0, 300-token greedy `--spec-type none`:
  text `6e8ccd25` (hybrid) vs `6129e077` (nccl), and the token-0 logits differ
  in the decode/verify band (W=6: `a4817ee6` vs `73ff91bf`).  The gate only
  holds where no cross-device reduction happens at all -- 1 GPU and
  `-sm layer` both gave `8fd24746` under either backend, because the AR is
  never reached.  Past records that quote the gate (e.g. `BASELINE.md`'s dated
  validation lines) are left as written per the dated-record policy; they were
  probably true at the text level for the split mode used, or a near-tie
  collision.  Docs corrected: `AGENTS.md` (verify recipe -- now says
  "smoke comparison only", with the measurements), `patches/README.md`
  (block-13 note), `archive/work/sm-tensor-plain-vs-spec/RUN.md` (the gate list).
  Not a correctness bug: the default (hybrid) path is self-consistent, which is
  what the n_max sweep gates.  It is a reminder that **text equality is
  evidence for purity, never evidence against divergence** -- the same trap as
  the 3-GPU `n_max = 8` false negative recorded in the entry above.

- **Block 12 amendment: verification matrix completed, and the boundary is `W = 8` / `n_max = 7`, not `n_max = 8` (2026-09-11).**
  Completes the entry above with the full per-configuration probe matrix and a
  correction to how the boundary is established.  The verified guarantee is
  **`--spec-draft-n-max <= 7`** (an 8-token verify batch) on the dense 27B with
  MTP, for 1 GPU, 2-GPU `-sm layer`, 2-GPU `-sm tensor` and 3-GPU
  `-sm tensor` alike; the first violating depth is `n_max = 8` (a 9-token
  batch).  The target verifies the drafts *plus* the last committed token, so
  `K = n_max + 1` -- `n_max = 8` is a 9-token batch, one past the designed
  `Q->ne[1] > 8` limit (cause B).
  Raw-logit probe (27B Q8_0, `RS = 0`, P = 256), `W = 1..8` -> `W = 9`:
  `4089b4d4` -> `72af52db` (1 GPU); `4089b4d4` -> `72af52db` (2-GPU `-sm layer`);
  `a4817ee6` -> `b059daa6` (2-GPU `-sm tensor`); `91434ea9` -> `bc3faabd`
  (3-GPU `-sm tensor`).  Uniform: bit-identical through `W = 8` everywhere,
  divergent at `W = 9` everywhere.  1 GPU and `-sm layer` share a hash because
  layer splitting changes no kernel; tensor splitting is the only configuration
  with different numeric paths (and the only one cause A could affect).
  **Method correction:** the 3-GPU 300-token *text* gate at `n_max = 8` matched
  the plain run (`5037ef2e` both) even though the logits had already diverged --
  no greedy near-tie flipped inside that window.  Text equality is evidence for
  purity, never evidence against divergence; boundaries must be established with
  the probe.  (This is the near-tie rarity noted in
  `archive/work/sm-tensor-plain-vs-spec/HANDOVER-2026-09-11.md`.)
  Cause B is left as-is by maintainer decision: correctness through `W = 8`
  is already far beyond what upstream delivers (upstream's CPU path diverges at
  the first width step, `W = 2`), and removing it would give up WMMA for
  9..N-token batches.  The gain from the block-12 fix (+12% MTP) is retained.

- **Block 12 amended: the hybrid all-reduce's size-based dispatch changed the reduction algorithm with the batch width (2026-09-11).**
  `ggml_backend_cuda_comm_is_small()` sent reductions below a per-device-count
  element count to the internal host-staged pipeline and everything above it to
  NCCL.  The two paths are **not bit-identical** (different summation order;
  the internal path always does the FP32->BF16 round-trip).  Under `-sm tensor`
  the reduced tensors scale with the batch width (`ne = ne0 * n_tokens`; ne0 =
  5120 on the 27B), so with the old 2-device value 32768 a **7-token**
  speculative verify batch (35840 elements) was reduced by NCCL while 1..6-token
  decode stayed on the internal pipeline: the same logical reduction, a
  different algorithm, purely because the batch got one token wider.  This -- not
  the GDN, and not MMVQ -- is what the earlier entries in this log called a
  pre-existing `n_max >= 6` divergence for 2-GPU `-sm tensor`.  (A second,
  *separate and deliberate* boundary remains at `W >= 9`: the FA launcher's
  tile-vs-WMMA switch at `Q->ne[1] > 8`, which caps the guaranteed range at
  `n_max <= 7` by design.  `GREEDY-PURITY.md` section 11 now states both causes
  and the per-configuration ranges.)
  **Fix:** raise the 2-device crossover 32768 -> 131072 (the 3-device value).
  The largest verify batch (`--spec-draft-n-max 16` -> 17 tokens = 87040
  elements) stays well under it, and still far below the internal pipeline's own
  1 MB (262144 element) cap, so nothing is pushed off the fast path.  Only
  7..25-token tensors change path; one-token decode and prefill (>25 tokens) are
  untouched.
  **Evidence** (27B Q8_0, 2-GPU tensor, `-ts 1/1`, probe/`llama-cli`):
  `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=internal` (one algorithm for every size) makes probe
  `W = 1/6/7/8` all `a4817ee6`; the fix does the same, with `W <= 6` keeping
  their previous hash, i.e. plain decode is bit-unchanged and only `W = 7,8`
  move onto the internal pipeline.  Text `none == n4 == n6 == n7` (`6e8ccd25`;
  previously pure only to `n_max 4`/5).  1-GPU `W=1 == W=8`; 3-GPU text
  `none == n6`; GDN K-independence `RS=6 W=6 == RS=0 W=1`; determinism `W=7`
  twice identical.
  **Perf is a win on both axes:** MTP `n_max 6` acceptance 0.509 -> 0.533 and
  63.6 -> 71.3 t/s (+12.1%); `n_max 12` 51.7 -> 58.0 t/s (+12.2%); llama-bench
  pp512 2009.08 -> 2004.12, pp4096 1905.00 -> 1907.41, tg128 31.92 -> 31.97
  (all unchanged within noise).
  **Localisation method** (temporary instrumentation, since reverted): a
  backend-side per-node digest dump in `ggml_backend_cuda_graph_compute`, gated
  on a phase file, reading each tensor through its own `nb[]` strides after a
  device sync.  `cb_eval` is unusable for this (it changes MoE numerics and
  aborts in the meta backend under tensor split), and `ggml_backend_tensor_get`
  flattens from the view's base pointer ignoring `nb[]`, which alone produced a
  field of false positives.  The dump showed the layer-0 GDN chain bit-exact and
  the first divergence exactly at the first cross-device reduction
  (`attn_residual-0`), whose buffer the meta backend rewrites in place between
  the producing MUL_MAT and its consumer.
  Canonical: block 12 `eec68b2ad` -> `cac14423e` (blocks 13/14 re-cut: `070096e16`
  -> `c43beca1b`, `30d119ea9` -> `daf32f804`), tip `daf32f804`, net tree
  `10f94d635`; clean-apply strict 15/15 `git am`, zero whitespace, applied tree
  == canonical; blocks 00-11 bodies byte-identical.

- **Block 02 amended (final form): the whole-batch K-independent chunked GDN prefill — free, no tail, no gate (2026-09-11).**
  Follows the KTAIL=16 entry below, which it supersedes.  Option B from
  `archive/work/sm-tensor-plain-vs-spec/FOLLOWUPS-2026-09-11.md`: instead of *sharing a
  sequential tail* between the plain (`K == 1`) and MTP (`K > 1`) prefills, both
  paths now make the **same call** — a batch with more than `max(K, 16)` tokens
  is chunked **whole**, exactly what `K == 1` already did, and anything smaller
  stays on the sequential kernel.  No tail, so the previous -0.3..-0.8 % tail
  cost goes to **zero**: 27B Q8_0 1 GPU pp512/2048/4096 = 1385.3/1356.4/1328.2
  vs 1384.7/1355.0/1327.8 for the old K-dependent boundary (parity), tg
  unchanged.  A batch larger than `max(K, 16)` cannot be a verify batch (those
  decode `<= K` tokens) and is never rolled back into, so its K snapshots are
  skipped; every verify batch keeps them.
  **Guard added** (the invariant is empirical): `llama_memory_recurrent::seq_rm`
  tracks the last batch's per-seq token count and logs a once-only warning if a
  rollback ever crosses that boundary.  Measured: 449 rollbacks over llama-cli
  `draft-mtp` n_max 1/4/8/16 + 20 in llama-server `--cache-reuse`, all preceded
  by a `<= K`-token batch, 0 warnings.
  **Removed**: `GGML_CUDA_GDN_ALIGN_BOUNDARY`, the `align_boundary` variable and
  both K-dependent branches (~118 lines) — they were unreachable with the gate
  ON, and the opt-out is superseded by `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0`, which is
  *both* correct (all snapshots written) and bit-identical plain-vs-MTP.
  **Gate re-verification** (all corrected against the new build): 27B 2-GPU
  tensor `none == n1 == n4 == n5` (`6e8ccd25`), 3-GPU tensor `none == n4`,
  1-GPU 4B probe `671d6096`, 27B prefill probe `W = 1/3/5/6` all `a4817ee6`
  with `RS=6 W=6 == RS=0 W=1` (prefill now K-independent), `test-backend-ops -o
  GATED_DELTA_NET` OK, 3x determinism check identical.
  **Correction (important):** the `n_max <= 15` purity claim in the entries
  below — and in every doc — was **wrong**; it was never validated past
  `n_max = 4`.  The real `none == draft-mtp` range is **`n_max <= 5`**, and the
  cause is a **pre-existing** multi-token-verify-batch MUL_MAT dispatch
  difference (identical divergence pattern on the delivered KTAIL=16 build;
  pure at `RS=0` up to `W = 6`, breaks at `W = 7`, again at `W >= 9` where MMVQ
  hands over to MMQ).  Upstream master is affected too and *worse*: on upstream
  `9cf3bf256` (CPU, 4B) `W = 1` already differs from `W >= 2`.  Docs corrected
  (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §11, `benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md` rule 4,
  `patches/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`); root-causing it is
  `archive/work/sm-tensor-plain-vs-spec/FOLLOWUPS-2026-09-11.md` Part 3.

  applied tree == canonical.

- **Block 02 amended: GDN alignment tail shortened to `KTAIL=16` (2026-09-11). — SUPERSEDED by the entry above.**  The aligned
  boundary's cost is entirely its sequential tail (which writes the K rollback snapshots), and the
  tail was 64 — ~16x longer than the default `--spec-draft-n-max 3` needs.  `KTAIL=16` covers
  `K <= 16` / `n_max <= 15`, including adaptive MTP's recommended `n_max = 12`; for deeper drafts the
  new `K > 16 ? K : 16` floor keeps the snapshots exact (those reproduce the pre-alignment `K > 1`
  boundary, i.e. correct-but-not-bit-identical, instead of reading stale snapshot slots).  Measured
  (27B Q8_0, 1 GPU, interleaved `-r 5`): `KTAIL=64` ≈ -1.5 %, **`KTAIL=16` ≈ -0.3..-0.8 %**,
  `KTAIL=8` ≈ 0; decode unchanged.  Bit-identity re-verified with `KTAIL=16`: 27B 2-GPU tensor
  probe W=1/3/5 and text `none == n1 == n2 == n4` (`e386b50d`), 3-GPU tensor `none == n4`, 4B 1-GPU.

- **Block 02 amended: `GGML_CUDA_GDN_ALIGN_BOUNDARY` flipped to default ON (opt-out), 2026-09-11.**
  The K-independent chunked-GDN boundary is now enabled by default (`GGML_CUDA_GDN_ALIGN_BOUNDARY=0`
  opts out and restores the K-dependent boundary).  This is the second of the two independent fixes
  required for `--spec-type none == draft-mtp`: with the block-13 dense-MMVQ alignment in place, the
  default is `none == n1 == n2 == n4` on 27B 2-GPU tensor (`5037ef2e`), 3-GPU tensor (`f60b79d0`),
  2-GPU layer and 1-GPU (`7d566fee`), and on the 4B 1-GPU probe.  Cost of the default
  (27B Q8_0, 1 GPU, llama-bench, `-r 5`, two alternating runs): pp512 1393.7/1384.5 ->
  1363.6/1363.8 (**-1.8 / -1.5 %**), pp2048 1362.2/1358.3 -> 1337.3/1338.1 (-1.8 / -1.5 %),
  pp4096 1329.5/1328.5 -> 1309.2/1309.6 (-1.5 %); decode unchanged (tg128 20.43 -> 20.40).  The
  maintainer accepted the prefill cost to close the divergence.  Canonical chain re-cut: block 02
  `38641280b` -> `d60bb52ef`, tip **`33ccf7e28`**, net tree **`31e153fe3`** (later re-cut again for KTAIL=16:
tip `30d119ea9`, tree `29714ad1f`); clean-apply strict 15/15
  `git am`, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree == canonical.

- **Block 13 amended: dense decode/verify MMVQ kernel alignment (`mmvq.cu`, 2026-09-11).**
  Closes the remaining batch-width half of the `-sm tensor` plain-vs-spec divergence.  Root cause:
  the block-13 `ncols_dst == 1` dispatch kept **dense** rows with `K < 4096` on the item-split/rpb
  kernel while the ncols 2..8 dispatch (and `K >= 4096` ncols==1) unconditionally use the ksplit
  kernel; the two accumulate K in different orders, so a single-token dense `MUL_MAT` is not
  row-identical to the same row in a 2..8-token verify batch (~1e-6 at the first divergent
  projection, amplified by the recurrent GDN).  Visible as `--spec-type none` != `draft-mtp` on
  small dense models (`n_embd < 4096`, e.g. Qwen3.5-4B, the cheap 1-GPU repro) and under
  `-sm tensor` on any model whose per-GPU K shard drops below 4096 (Qwen3.8-27B 5120 -> 2560).
  Fix: `!has_ids || ncols_x >= 4096` — dense rows always ksplit; `MUL_MAT_ID`/MoE keeps the
  item-split (its multi-token kernel is `mul_mat_vec_q_moe`).  Verified per-process (token-0 logit
  hash, callback-free): 4B 1-GPU and 27B 2-GPU-tensor W=1/3/5 bit-identical (was 0.133 on the
  27B).  Perf neutral (4B/27B/MoE-A3B within noise, MoE tg128 95.66 -> 96.02); MTP gates
  0.487/36.5 (dense) and 0.675/153.1 (MoE); `GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46; hybrid-vs-NCCL coherence
  identical.  **The default-config `-sm tensor` text equality additionally requires the block-02
  `GGML_CUDA_GDN_ALIGN_BOUNDARY=1` gate** (K-dependent chunked-GDN prefill boundary); that gate
  stays opt-in because it costs ~2-2.6% prefill.  Canonical chain re-cut: block 13
  `fc7f52f96` -> `029b07b30`, tip **`27bd754b6`**, net tree **`c0775c33c`**; clean-apply strict

- **Block 02 amended: opt-in K-independent chunked-GDN boundary (`GGML_CUDA_GDN_ALIGN_BOUNDARY=1`, 2026-09-11).**
  Fixes the fork-only plain-vs-spec divergence found during the gfx1151 issue-#25 validation (the issue
  #25 *follow-up*): the chunked GDN prefill had a **K-dependent** chunk/sequential boundary (plain
  `K == 1` chunked the whole prompt; MTP `K == n_max + 1` chunked `n_tokens - K` + a K-token tail), so
  the post-prefill SSM state depended on `n_rs_seq` and `--spec-type none` disagreed with `draft-mtp`
  (greedy near-ties flipped).  The amendment adds a gated third branch that chunks `n_tokens - 64` and
  runs the sequential kernel over the last 64 for both `K == 1` and `K > 1`, giving one boundary and one
  state; the tail also emits the K snapshots (rollback <= 63 exact), and `n_seqs > 1` keeps the old
  whole-ubatch path.  **Default OFF** — the fork's existing boundary is deliberate and ~1.1-1.2 % faster
  prefill; the gate only guards the two existing branch conditions, so the default output is
  **byte-identical** (`d9bf6850`), while with the gate on `none == n2 == n4` (`1a9ef0a1`, which also
  equals the `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0` reference on the short prompts).  gfx1201 probe (`RS=from_w`,
  P=256): `W1-W3/W3-W5 = 0.136693/0.182106` default (unchanged) -> `0.000000/0.000000` gated;
  `test-backend-ops -o GATED_DELTA_NET` 46/46 in default, gated and gated+fp32.  Record:
  `archive/work/issue-25-mtp-batch-width/GDN-CHUNKED-PREFILL-FIX.md`.  Canonical fork rebuilt at `9113cc188`,
  block 02 (`5cbfbafd9` -> `38641280b`) amended by rebase, new tip **`7b79930b2`**, net tree
  `fcf3e4bb7`; clean-apply **strict 15/15 `git am`**, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree ==
  canonical.  A separate `-sm tensor` (2/3-GPU) plain-vs-spec divergence — independent of GDN and of
  this gate — is documented there as an open follow-up (the server's 3-GPU tensor-split config is
  affected).

- **Block 00 (structural and architecture fixes) added; the set is now 15 patches and the masked-V
  freed-cell fixes are re-homed (2026-09-10).**  A new first block, `patches/0000`, holds baseline-level
  fixes every later block builds on:
  1. **FA small-batch KV-split width invariance (issue #25).**  `launch_fattn`'s non-stream-K
     `parallel_blocks` heuristic keys off `ntiles_dst`, which is a function of `Q->ne[1]`, so
     single-token decode (`n_q = 1`) and speculative verify batches (`n_q = 3`, `5`, …) chose different
     KV splits, fed different partial sums into the online-softmax/PV combine and produced different
     logits; greedy near-ties then flipped, so MTP `--spec-draft-n-max 2` and `4` streamed apart.  The
     heuristic now evaluates `ntiles_dst` as if `n_q == 1` for every `n_q <= 8` (prefill unchanged).
  2. **Vulkan masked-V / freed-cell fixes** (`flash_attn_cm1.comp`, `flash_attn.comp`): dead columns
     never read V.  These are baseline shaders, so they belong in the structural block.
  The **HIP** masked-V fixes do **not** belong in block 00: the `fattn-tile.cuh` half uses the native
  bf16 PV staging (`V_k0`/`KQ_k`/`nv_bfloat162`) that **block 03** introduces, and the
  `fattn-mma-f16.cuh` half fixes the same class of leak on that path — so, per the maintainer, both HIP
  halves were **moved into block 03** (the earliest block that exercises the leaking code).  Block 14 no
  longer carries any masked-V/freed-cell hunk.  The net tree is unchanged from the previous regeneration
  (`26690e4d9`).  The block-15 attention-memory campaign is unaffected and remains staged in
  `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/`.
  Layout: `0000` = block 00, `0001`–`0014` = the old blocks 01–14 (renumbered by
  `git format-patch --start-number 0`, so the file prefix still equals the block number; the subjects
  read `[PATCH 00/14]`…`[PATCH 14/14]`).  Canonical fork rebuilt at `9113cc188`, tip **`505637d6e`**;
  `scripts/apply-all.sh` and `scripts/make-patches.sh` updated (15 blocks, `0000` included);
  `rdna-boosts-all.patch` regenerated.
  Validation (3× gfx1201, ROCm 7.14): clean-apply sim → strict **15/15 `git am`, zero whitespace
  warnings**, applied tree `26690e4d9` == canonical; issue #25 → `--spec-draft-n-max 2 == 4` on 2-GPU
  p0/p2/p3 and 3-GPU p0, `draft-mtp-adaptive` == both; plain decode (`--spec-type none`) byte-identical
  to the pre-block-00 canonical on 2-GPU and 1-GPU; MTP acceptance gate holds (dense 0.479, MoE 0.669,
  MTP >> plain both).  A `structural-fixes` branch (block 00 + blocks 01–14, based directly on
  `9113cc188` = the fork's master) was pushed to the personal fork for the gfx1151 investigation; the
  upstream-PR candidate `upstream/UPSTREAM-PR-fa-kv-split-width.{patch,md}` was filed under `upstream/`.

- **Block 15 un-promoted from the delivery — it belongs only in `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/`
  (2026-09-10).**  Block 15 was promoted into `patches/0015` by mistake; the maintainer never
  approved cutting it as a delivery patch.  The delivery is a **14-patch set** again
  (`patches/0001`-`0014`, canonical tip `ff2b35f49`), `scripts/apply-all.sh` and
  `scripts/make-patches.sh` are back to 14 blocks, `rdna-boosts-all.patch` is the 14-block net,
  and the docs/headers no longer present Block 15 as delivered.  The block-15 work (including
  the 2026-09-10 V5 and RDNA3_5/gfx1151 amendments) continues to live only in
  `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/block-15-campaign-wins.patch` and is applied manually on top of
  the 14-block tree, pending the maintainer's promotion go-ahead.  The `0001`-`0014` bodies are
  unchanged from the promoted set; only the `From <sha>` line and the `[PATCH NN/15]` →
  `[PATCH NN/14]` series count differ.  Clean-apply sim: fresh worktree at `9113cc188` +
  `apply-all.sh` → strict 14/14 `git am`, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree `6ce36849` ==
  the canonical 14-block tree.  (The dated entries below that say "cut" / "15-patch" record the
  promotion as it happened; this entry reverses it.)

- **RDNA3_5 (gfx1151) validation of the 14-block delivery + the beta block-15 patch; V3 iGPU enablement + multi-stream
  guard folded into the beta block-15 patch (2026-09-10, single Strix Halo, ROCm 7.14).**  The first
  single-device iGPU run of the delivery (Radeon 8060S, `VMM: no`, 1 device).  Block-14
  masked-V fixes, V3 derived mask, V4 native q8_0 and V5 native bf16 were exercised with
  a BF16 KV cache in both arm states, per the sign-leak campaign matrix.  Two V3
  regressions found and fixed as a dated amendment to the **beta** block-15 patch (the delivery
  stays 14 patches; beta patch tip `377f8e790`):
  1. the derived-mask probe rejected `GGML_BACKEND_DEVICE_TYPE_IGPU`, so V3 was silently
     disabled on the HIP iGPU and its ~800 MiB compute + ~800 MiB host win was lost;
     `ggml_backend_dev_is_cuda()` / `ggml_backend_dev_implements_kq_derived()` now accept
     `IGPU` (ROCm/CUDA reg name still required);
  2. `n_seq_max > 1` aborted context creation in `ggml_flash_attn_ext_add_kq_derived`
     (`GGML_ASSERT(tok_lo->ne[0] == a->src[0]->ne[1])`): `build_attn_mha` derives the
     stream count from `k->ne[3]` (the cache's `n_stream` == `n_seq_max`), while
     `kq_mask_derivable()` only checked `ubatch.n_seqs_unq`; it now rejects
     `n_stream != 1`, so a multi-slot context keeps the packed mask (no abort) and a
     single-stream context keeps the win.  `llama-server --parallel 4`, which aborted on
     the pre-amendment tree, now serves and passes the 16-run gate.

  KV cache no longer needs the F16 staging scratch: bf16 and f16 tiles have the same
  byte layout, so the MMA loader converts each 16-byte staged chunk in registers
  (`__float22half2_rn(ggml_cuda_cast<float2>(bf16x2))`, bit-identical to the
  launcher's `ggml_get_to_fp16_cuda(GGML_TYPE_BF16)`) instead of copying from the
  scratch, and the scratch sizing + whole-cache conversion pass are skipped for that
  operand.  The per-operand staging source is now one shared type code
  (`fattn_kv_native_t{FATTN_KV_NATIVE_NONE,Q8_0,BF16}`, subsuming V4's flags), so the
  launcher, `get_alloc_size` and the kernels cannot disagree.  Scope per D10: the F16
  fragments/`cp_async` design is untouched (no bf16 WMMA fragments).
  **Measured (ctx 204800, bf16 KV, arm on vs off):** 4B ub 2048 968.86 -> **256.86**
  MiB/GPU (== the f16 cache; ub 1024 884.82 -> 128.82, ub 512 842.80 -> 64.80), 27B
  1072.86 -> **488.86** (ub 512 868.80 -> 122.80), gemma-4-E4B 1062.89 -> **404.89**,
  gemma-4-31B 2068.89 -> **716.89**; qwen4exp unchanged (f16 == bf16 == on/off there,
  its FA path never staged bf16) and its q8_0 control reproduced 3251.39/63.69
  exactly, confirming the refactor left V4 alone; ub 8 (TILE/verify) 8.09 either way.
  **Cost** (interleaved same-binary A/B, off -> on, bf16): 4B -0.22 % (pp2048),
  +0.27 % (8192), -1.06 % (20480), -2.36 % (40960); 27B -0.76 % (20480); decode
  within 0.1 %.  The conversion itself is free (native bf16 staging is within 0.17 %
  of an *f16* cache) — the loss is the removed scratch, which is a dense, normalised
  copy of the cache view (the GQA heads are interleaved: `nb[1]` is 2048 B for a
  512 B row on the 4B), while the native path re-reads the interleaved view on every
  staging pass.  **Decision: opt-in via `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE` (default 0), i.e.
  the maintainer's explicit instruction for this item ("treat it similarly to V4 ...
  gated by the same environment variable"), consistent with D9.**
  **Gates:** same-seed text byte-identical (arm on vs off vs f16) on 4B, 27B,
  gemma-4-E4B (ISWA) and gemma-4-31B (ISWA), short + 3k/40k prompts, with V3's
  derived mask active (wins additive: -799.2 derived mask, -712.0 bf16 scratch on
  the 4B); MTP 27B 0.82716 and qwen4exp 0.44262 identical on/off (q8_0 references
  0.76744/0.44262 unchanged); `test-backend-ops` FLASH_ATTN_EXT 7859/7859 ROCm0+CPU,
  with the 2704 bf16 K/V cases (all head sizes incl. the 576/512 MLA
  `v_is_view_of_k` layout) and 365 q8_0 cases green in both arm states, identical case
  lists.  Re-validated end to end **from the delivered patches**: fresh worktree at
  `9113cc188` -> `apply-all.sh` strict 15/15 `git am`, tree identical to `f5ab5350b`,
  build, reserves/coherence/MTP/op-suite all reproduced.  One pre-existing
  unrelated full-build warning recorded in `TODO.md`
  (`llama-kv-cache.h:274` `-Wunused-private-field` for W3's `v_enabled`).
  Records: the V5 amendment section in `patches/README.md`, the outcome section in
  `archive/work/arch-independent-memory/BF16-NATIVE-KV-PLAN.md`, the block-15 beta record.

- **bf16-native MMA K/V planned as the next essential follow-up (D12); two pre-existing findings
  recorded (2026-09-10).**  With Block 15 cut, the maintainer picked the bf16 lever as the one
  follow-up.  The executable plan is **`archive/work/arch-independent-memory/BF16-NATIVE-KV-PLAN.md`**:
  measured before-state in the *delivered* tree, the mechanism with exact call sites, the design
  (keep the F16 fragments, `cp_async` the raw bf16 bytes into the same shared offsets — a 16-byte
  chunk is 8 elements either way — then convert the tile in place), the validation protocol and a
  three-way ship rule (expectation: **on by default**, unlike V4, because the `cp_async` pipeline is
  kept).  Also `HANDOVER.md` D11/D12 and the §8 prompt.
  **Before-state (ctx 204800, V3 on, f16 = reference):** 4B (1 GPU) ub 2048 256.86 -> **968.86**
  (+712.00), ub 1024 +756.00, ub 512 +778.00; 27B (3-GPU Meta) ub 2048 488.86 -> **1072.86** (+584.00),
  ub 512 +746.00; ub 8 (TILE/verify) **identical** at 8.09 MiB; `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE=1` (V4) changes
  no bf16 row (it is q8_0-only).
  **Finding 1 (pre-existing, documented not fixed): mixed K/V types fall off the GPU attention path.**
  Any mixed pair (`bf16`+`q8_0`, `f16`+`q8_0`, either direction) reserves `graph splits = 18` (vs 2),
  moves ~1.5 GiB into the host compute buffer and loses the FA scratch; 4B pp2048/tg128: `q8_0/q8_0`
  7924.47/98.94, `bf16/q8_0` 640.25/61.57, `q8_0/bf16` 1048.66/68.54, `f16/q8_0` 852.57/54.39.  So
  "bf16 keys + q8_0 values" is not usable today; same-type K/V is the practical choice.  Fixing it
  needs the FA kernels to accept a mixed `(type_K, type_V)` pair — larger than V3/V4, out of scope.
  **Finding 2 (pre-existing): gemma-4-E4B-it + 3-GPU `-sm tensor`** aborts in the meta splitter
  (`n_head_kv = 2` < 3 devices); maintainer's call (D11): **document only, do not fix** — small model,
  unlikely configuration; it runs on 1/2 GPUs and with `-sm layer`.
- **Block 15 cut (2026-09-10) — the attention-memory campaign wins;
the set is now 15 patches (block-15 tip `09a137566` on the canonical fork
rebuilt at `9113cc188`), beta-staged in `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/`.**
  The campaign (`archive/work/arch-independent-memory/`, `archive/work/qwen4exp/qsa-memory/`)
  was merged into one block by replaying the validated work-branch tree
  onto block 14, then re-validated **as a combination** (the per-win
  records did not carry over on their own).  Six wins, each with an
  environment A/B gate; **V4 is opt-in** (an *enable* switch) per the
  maintainer's rule of 2026-09-10 (a sub-2 % loss with a large memory win
  and no cheap fix ships opt-in):

  | win | mechanism | gate (default) | measured (ctx 204800, q8_0 KV, ub 2048) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | W1 | QSA score chain: relu before the 4-D reshape + `n_blocks`-chunked `ggml_concat` assembly | `GGML_QSA_SCORE_MEM` (1) | qwen4exp 6690.40 -> 4450.40 MiB/GPU (ub1024 3346.50 -> 2274.35) |
  | W2 | derived QSA per-block bias + derived visibility; bias/mask no longer materialised; input-fill null guards (incl. the `llm_graph_input_attn_k` one) | `GGML_QSA_DERIVED_BIAS` (1), `GGML_QSA_DERIVED_VIS` (1), `LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA` (sparse) | qwen4exp 4450.40 -> **3251.39** MiB/GPU, host 1262.70 -> **63.69** MiB |
  | W3 | keys-only QSA indexer cache (`v_enabled` in `llama_kv_cache`; no V tensor, no V-side op) | `LLAMA_QSA_KEYS_ONLY` (1) | indexer KV 956.26 -> **318.76** MiB/GPU |
  | W4 | ggml-alloc releases view sources whose views are never consumed (the uncounted-view leak) | none — a bug fix; `archive/work/block-15-campaign-wins/ab/w4-revert.patch` | repro 56.00 -> 16.00 MiB; no reserve change on any model |
  | V3 | derived kq mask: `GGML_OP_FLASH_ATTN_EXT` src[5..7] carry compact per-cell state and the MMA FA kernel derives visibility in-kernel; the packed mask tensor is still built in every graph and simply loses its consumer (so no model allowlist and no mis-served consumer) | `LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED` (1; `0` = packed) | 4B 1800.33 -> **1001.13**, 27B 1920.33 -> **1121.13** MiB/GPU; host -799.21; gemma-4-E4B/-31B (ISWA) -809.18/-811.17; scales as `n_kv x n_tps x 2 B` |
  | V4 | native q8_0 K/V in the FA kernels: dequantise during the shared-tile staging (16-byte chunk = 8 elements = a quarter q8_0 block) instead of staging a whole-cache F16 copy | `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE` (**default 0 = opt-in**) | 4B -> **257.13**, 27B -> **489.13**, gemma-4-31B -1224 MiB/GPU; qwen4exp unchanged |

  **The wins compose additively** — qwen4exp ub 2048: pristine 6690.40 ->
  W1 only 4450.40 -> W2 only 5491.39 -> W1+W2 3251.39 (W1 -2240, W2
  -1199, W3 -637.5/GPU, V3 -799, V4 -744/-632); both W gates off
  reproduces the pristine 6690.40/1262.70 exactly.  **Cost**: V3 -1.28 %
  prefill (4B pp20480/ub 2048, interleaved same-binary A/B) / +0.28 %
  (27B), decode -0.32 %/-0.15 %; V4 a further -1.85 % (4B) / -1.72 %
  (27B) prefill — the loss is the lost `cp_async` pipeline (a quantized
  source cannot be copied asynchronously; a 2-byte-access pass changed
  nothing), decode within noise, hence opt-in.

  **Combination validation (all on the merged tree, and then re-run from
  the delivered patches — see below):** reserve matrix on 4B (1 GPU), 27B
  (3-GPU Meta), gemma-4-E4B (1 GPU), gemma-4-31B (3-GPU) and qwen4exp
  (3-GPU) at ub 2048/1024/512 x V4 off/on — every number matches the
  per-win records; same-seed generated text **byte-identical** on all
  five models across every gate combination (V3 x V4 on the dense
  models; W1/W2/W3/V3/V4 — 7 configurations — on qwen4exp) at a short and
  a 40k-token prompt; adaptive-MTP gate **unchanged** (27B inline draft
  0.76744 (66/86, mean 3.28) in all four gate combinations; qwen4exp
  draft 0.44262 (54/122) in all six, **equal to the block-14 baseline**,
  and MTP stays +26 % over plain decode at ctx 32768); `test-backend-ops`
  FLASH_ATTN_EXT on ROCm0 (both V4 gates) and CPU, the six derived FA
  cases, VIEW/CONT/CPY/DUP/CONCAT, `test-alloc`, `test-batch-alloc`; the
  W4 revert restores `ggml-alloc.c` byte-identically to block 14.

  **Two things worth recording.**  (1) Re-validation caught a real wiring
  bug before the cut: the W3 gate was passed to `v_enabled` with the
  wrong polarity, so the indexer cache stayed keys-only-disabled (956.26
  MiB) while `LLAMA_QSA_KEYS_ONLY=0` enabled it — fixed and re-verified
  (`956.26 -> 318.76` on the default, `956.26` with the gate off).  This
  is exactly what the combination pass is for.  (2) A **pre-existing**
  bug was found (it reproduces on block 14=HEAD, so it is not a block-15
  regression): `gemma-4-E4B-it` on **3 GPUs with `-sm tensor`** aborts in
  the meta splitter (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp:1177`) on a FLASH_ATTN_EXT
  node whose K source has zero extent on one buffer, because `n_head_kv =
  2` is fewer than the device count (2 heads / 3 devices leaves one
  device with nothing).  It runs on 1 GPU, on 2 GPUs and on 3 GPUs with
  `-sm layer`; the 27B (4 KV heads) and gemma-4-31B (4/16) are
  unaffected.  Diagnosed by instrumenting the failing assert to print the
  op/tensor/split geometry (temporary change, reverted).  Left unfixed —
  out of scope for this block — and documented in `patches/README.md`.

  **Regeneration and delivery mechanics.**  The reference fork checkout
  (`~/llama.cpp`, branch `rdna-boosts`) had been rebased onto a master
  that is **two commits newer than the recorded fork point** (`f3f1a8f27`
  iGPU lazy-load default + `304665fe7` SYCL IQ-type-for-MoE, both
  2026-09-08/09, i.e. after `9113cc188`), so `format-patch
  9113cc188..tip` there would have exported those two upstream commits as
  patches 0001/0002 — a latent trap for any future regeneration.  The
  patches were therefore regenerated from a **canonical fork rebuilt at
  `9113cc188`** via `scripts/apply-all.sh` (strict 15/15 `git am`, zero
  whitespace warnings), and the resulting tree was verified identical to
  the validated tree except for the 3 files of those two upstream commits
  (`ggml-sycl` x2, `src/llama-model.cpp` — outside the validated paths).
  The delivered `0001`-`0014` files were kept byte-for-byte (the
  regenerated ones differ only in the `From <sha>` line and the
  `[PATCH NN/15]` series count, verified content-identical hunk by hunk);
  `0015-rdna-boosts-block-15-campaign-memory-wins.patch` is new.
  `make-patches.sh`'s default tip is now `09a137566`, the canonical
  block-15 commit (the local branch `block15-canonical` in the fork
  checkout keeps that chain alive).  `rdna-boosts-all.patch` = `git diff
  9113cc188..09a137566` (98 files).

  **Clean-apply simulation (the delivered artifact, end to end):** fresh
  worktree at `9113cc188` -> `scripts/apply-all.sh` (15/15 strict
  `git am`) -> fresh `gfx1201` Release build -> reserves (4B 1001.13 /
  257.13, 27B 1121.13 / 489.13, qwen4exp 3251.39 with the indexer KV at
  318.76), byte-identical coherence on 4B/27B/gemma-4-E4B/qwen4exp with
  every gate flipped, MTP 0.76744 / 0.44262, and the op suites — all
  green.

  **Upstream-drop check (2026-09-10):** GitHub was unreachable from this
  host (SSH key denied), so the check ran against the recorded upstream
  base `9cf3bf256`: the `ggml-alloc` unused-view release (W4), the
  keys-only indexer cache (W3) and the `llm_graph_input_attn_k`
  null-mask guard are all **still absent upstream** (the first two apply
  cleanly, the guard's call site is still unguarded while its own
  `can_reuse_impl` accepts a null mask), so Block 15 keeps every hunk.
  Re-check after the next `git fetch` before filing the `upstream/`
  candidates.

  **Upstream candidates A1/A2 prepared on a pristine master worktree
  (2026-09-10):** the `upstream/` backlog is now empty (four candidates,
  each with its own `.md` evidence):
  - **A1 `UPSTREAM-PR-kv-cache-keys-only`** (win W3): verified on
    unadulterated master `9cf3bf256` (CPU build, the real 3-shard qwen4exp
    IQ4_XS GGUF) -- the upstream indexer KV buffer is **72.00 MiB at ctx
    8192 (K 24.00 + V 48.00)** and drops to **24.00 MiB (K only)** with the
    patch; same-seed text byte-identical; `test-alloc` all PASSED,
    `test-batch-alloc` 0 failures.  The shape is worth noting: the store
    overrides the *key* head to the indexer size (128) but inherits the
    model's *value* head (256), so the dead V is twice the K it never
    accompanies.  Method note: the first upstream A/B was measured with
    `git apply -3` (which stages), so `git checkout -- .` did not revert it
    and both runs measured the patched tree; the `git reset --hard` re-run
    is the real unpatched number above.
  - **A2 `UPSTREAM-PR-attn-k-null-mask-guard`** (part of win W2): verified
    on master -- applies clean, compiles, byte-identical same-seed text;
    recorded in its notes as **hardening, not a live fix** (every upstream
    construction site builds a mask, and `can_reuse_kq_mask` itself
    dereferences it, so the guarded branch is unreachable upstream today).
    It is what the sibling `attn_kv` class already does and the prerequisite
    for a future null-mask feature.
  Both patches were apply-checked on pristine master (individually and
  together: 4 files, +18/-7); the master worktrees were reset afterwards.

- **Block-14 amendment (2026-09-10) — freed-cell KV handling moved from the
  host-side zeroing to kernel-side masked-V elimination; the gfx1151-only
  `zero_freed` host zeroing (2026-09-09 amendment) is REMOVED (block-14 tip
  `ff2b35f49` on `9113cc188`, regenerated 2026-09-10; blocks 01-13 patch
  files byte-identical).**  `src/llama-kv-cache.{cpp,h}` are back to the
  upstream state — no `zero_freed`/`rows_hw`/`sharers` wiring, no env
  `LLAMA_KV_ZERO_FREED`, no per-free GPU memsets; evicting a resident KV
  sequence is pure host cell bookkeeping again on every device.  In its
  place block 14 now carries the three **kernel-side** fixes that make the
  content of fully-masked (freed/stale) flash-attention cells unreadable,
  so the host workaround is unnecessary:
  - HIP `fattn-tile.cuh` (packed-bf16 PV path): zero the per-warp V
    register copies of rows whose P is +0.0 across the warp's columns
    before the bf16 dot.
  - HIP `fattn-mma-f16.cuh`: after each V-tile slice is staged in shared
    memory, zero the rows the mask tile marks blocked (-inf) for every
    query column of the block; one extra uniform barrier, masked path
    (`ncols2 > 1 || mask_h`) only; compile-time excluded for the
    `V_is_K_view` and NVIDIA-swizzled (`swz_V`) paths.
  - Vulkan `flash_attn_cm1.comp` + `flash_attn.comp` scalar path: never
    read V of fully masked columns (dead columns keep V = +0.0).
  All three are unconditional in their kernel paths (no arch/env gating) —
  generic correctness fixes for masked/freed FA cells (batch serving, KV
  eviction) active by default on every device.  Root cause (Strix Halo,
  gfx1151): WMMA f16 `x + (-0.0)` is inexact, so a masked column leaked
  the sign of whatever V its cell last held; the fix guarantees masked
  cells contribute exactly +0.0 at the multiply.  Validation on the
  gfx1151 box (ROCm 7.14-gfx1151 + Vulkan RADV), host zeroing disabled:
  16/16 identical-request determinism gates PASS on every KV cache type
  each backend's FA supports — ROCm f16/bf16/q8_0/q4_0 (plus ON==OFF
  bit-identical over 2064 cells/run), Vulkan also q4_1/q5_0/q5_1/iq4_nl;
  `test-backend-ops` FLASH_ATTN_EXT vs CPU 4591/4591 (ROCm) and
  7822/7822 (Vulkan); CPU same-seed greedy 51/64 tokens identical,
  divergence only at a near-tie (CPU non-FA vs GPU FA numerics);
  depth-16384 llama-bench decode tg128 within 0.05% of pre-fix, pp within
  single-run drift.  Full record:
  `archive/work/strix-halo/kvzero/RECORD-2026-09-09.md` +
  `archive/work/kv-sign-leak/HANDOVER-2026-09-09-mma-f16.md`.  Delivery:
  regenerated `patches/0014` only (blocks 01-13 patch bodies
  byte-identical) + `rdna-boosts-all.patch`; clean-apply sim at
  `9113cc188` strict 14/14 `git am`, zero whitespace warnings, applied
  tree == fork tip `ff2b35f49`; final-tree rebuild (delta vs the
  validated kernel-fix tree = the llama-kv-cache revert only) passes the
  16/16 gate and no longer logs the freed-cell zeroing.

- **Block-14 amendment (2026-09-09) — freed-cell KV-zeroing gated to gfx1151
  (fork block-01 commit `7c4d9c4e0`, block-14 tip `27485f1ca`, 14 commits on
  `9113cc188`; previous tip `0f2b7a4e1` superseded).**  Block 14's
  `seq_rm`/`seq_keep`/`clear` row zeroing (freed KV cells kept at +0.0 as a
  masked-column guard for the gfx1151/Strix-Halo WMMA f16 `x+(-0.0)`
  inexactness, ported from the strix lineage commit aad5adb08f) is now
  **enabled only when a KV-cache buffer device description carries `gfx1151`**
  (env `LLAMA_KV_ZERO_FREED=0/1` overrides the auto detection).  Everywhere
  else the pre-block-14 behavior is restored: evicting a resident KV sequence
  is pure host cell bookkeeping again.  Reason: without the gate, freeing an
  N-token sequence issued ~48×N per-cell 512-byte memsets (ggml's
  meta/multi-buffer memset decomposes one per-layer zeroing call into one
  synced `cudaMemsetAsync` per cell across the GPU head-split sub-buffers,
  each ~30-60 µs), so replacing a ~13k-token KV stalled ~18-24 s before the
  new prefill began on multi-GPU RDNA4 (3x R9700 gfx1201; reproduced on a
  plain dense 4B model too — model-agnostic).  Verified: on gfx1201 the
  A/B stall is gone (identical workload 24.5 s -> ~6 s) and the zeroing-off
  determinism gate passes (16 + 8 identical greedy requests, per-position
  top-8 logprobs float64-compared — the same gate that found the leak on
  gfx11); on the gfx1151 Halo box the gate enables
  ("freed-cell KV row zeroing enabled (gfx1151)") and the 16-run control is
  unchanged.  Regenerated `patches/0014` only (blocks 01-13 patch bodies
  byte-identical); clean-apply sim at `9113cc188` strict 14/14 `git am`,
  zero whitespace warnings, applied tree == fork tip `27485f1ca`.
  Follow-up (open): develop a performant gfx1151 flash-attn kernel-side fix
  so the host-side zeroing can be removed entirely.

- **Block-01 refresh (2026-09-09) — adaptive MTP draft depth updated to the
  llama.cpp PR #27210 review head (fork block-01 commit `7c4d9c4e0`,

  previous set (am-tip `050ec89ce`), block 01 replaced in place by the
  squashed PR-head changeset, blocks 02-14 `git rebase --onto` (clean,
  no conflicts — blocks 02-13 touch no block-01 file, block 14's
  common/arg/common.h hunks are disjoint).  Tree verification: old-tip..
  new-tip delta is exactly the review changeset (13 files, 129+/70-, ==
  `0994374fd..d236d41a2`), every other file byte-identical; regenerated
  0002-0013 patch bodies byte-identical to the previous delivery, 0014
  refreshed only in index lines/hunk offsets for the 3 common files;
  regenerated 0001 diff body byte-identical to the PR head changeset.
  Verification (local 3x R9700, gfx1201, ROCm 7.14): clean-apply sim at
  `9113cc188` strict 14/14 `git am`, zero whitespace warnings, applied
  tree == fork tip; rebuilt `test-arg-parser` + `test-speculative-
  adaptive` pass; plain-decode same-seed coherence (seed 42/temp 0,
  Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0) token-IDENTICAL to the known-good `050ec89ce` build.
  The refresh touches no GPU kernels and no non-speculative host decode
  path — all changes live in the MTP-typed/adaptive code, the option
  parser and comments/docs.

- **Re-base (2026-09-08) — delivery moved to upstream master `9113cc188`
  (block-14 tip `78e67a3d8`).**  Upstream moved 14 commits past the
  `050dde50c` fork point (server checkpoint eviction, Kimi-K3 recurrent
  rollback, chat-parser split, ggml_prec spec, metal/vulkan/opencl fixes,
  spec single-device meta-wrapper handling #28390, and — decisive for this
  re-base — `d4389a4dd`/PR #28604 which **reverted #24233**, the very
  change block 06 diverged from).  An `apply-all.sh` run against the fresh
  master tip failed at block 06 in a way even `git am -3` cannot fix: the
  upstream revert deleted block 06's pre-image, so the block's change is a
  no-op on the new base (nothing left for the patch to do).  Resolution:
  block 06 was reduced to a host-buffer **rationale marker** commit (6
  comment lines above the now-unconditional `integrated = false` in
  `ggml-cuda.cu`), keeping the 14-block structure and all downstream block
  numbers intact; block 14's quantized-KV tensor-split gate merged
  **additively** with #28390's single-device `SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR` warn in
  `src/llama-context.cpp` (both kept, in sequence; #28390's code comment
  shows the same single-device-no-meta-wrapper intent as block 07, so no
  semantic collision).  Content verification against the previous delivery
  (re-applied at `050dde50c`): blocks 01-05 and 07-13 are byte-identical;
  block 06 differs as designed; block 14 differs only in the
  llama-context.cpp resolution region.  Regenerated at `9113cc188`
  (`f84549d23..78e67a3d8`) and clean-apply re-verified (strict 14/14
  `git am`, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree == fork tip
  `78e67a3d8`).  Coherence verified on the Strix box (gfx1151, ROCm 7.14):
  llama-cli same-seed output IDENTICAL to the canonical `72f0ee944` build
  (tensor + layer split x f16/q8_0/bf16 KV, and a long-prompt run at depth
  16384), clean runtime diagnostics, and the dense adaptive-MTP gate green
  on the new build (draft acceptance 0.833 at acc/pos 0.944/0.833/0.722;
  draft-mtp 20.3 t/s vs plain 7.9 t/s on the same prose prompt; MTP
  same-seed byte-identical old-vs-new).  The previous `050dde50c`-based
  regeneration (`d65a96084..ce641322e`) is superseded; the pre-re-base fork
  chain is preserved at `backup-rdna-boosts-bfcc4be99` and the known-good
  `72f0ee944` binary under `/tmp/rdna-ref-bin/` (session-local).

- **Block-14 amendment (3rd on 2026-09-08) — quantized-KV tensor-split
  gate:** the `q4_1`-family KV cache types (`q4_1`, `q5_0`, `q5_1`,
  `iq4_nl`) aborted during the first graph reserve under multi-GPU
  `SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR` on gfx1201 (3x R9700) —
  `ggml-backend-meta.cpp:538 GGML_ASSERT(ret.axis != GGML_BACKEND_SPLIT_AXIS_UNKNOWN)`
  — on both dense qwen35 (Qwen3.6-27B) and qwen4exp (Flash-Next), with
  `f32/f16/bf16/q8_0/q4_0` KV and layer split passing.  Root cause is
  **upstream**: reproduced on pristine vanilla llama.cpp at the fork
  point `050dde50c` (identical assert, non-qwen4exp Qwen3.5-4B; also at
  1 GPU, since upstream wraps even a single device in the Meta backend)
  and still unfixed on current upstream master.  Tensor split forces
  flash attention, whose CUDA/HIP kernels read the quantized K/V cache
  natively only for `q4_0`/`q8_0` (plus the float types); for the
  q4_1-family types the attention subgraph is externalized into
  op-NONE graph leaves (MIRRORED split state) which collide with the
  AXIS-0 elementwise gate branch of the qwen35/qwen4exp gated attention
  at the `attn_gated` `MUL` — the meta splitter cannot reconcile
  MIRRORED x AXIS-0.  Fix: a context-creation gate in
  `llama_init_from_model` (`llama-context.cpp`, block-14-owned in the
  set) that rejects K/V types outside FA's native set with a clear
  error when the Meta device is actually in use (tensor split over
  >= 2 GPUs; the fork's single-GPU "tensor" mode skips the Meta wrapper
  and is untouched — upstream, whose 1-GPU mode also wraps Meta, gets
  the clean error too).  Validated 2026-09-08 on gfx1201 (3x R9700,
  ROCm 7.14): KV-type matrix on dense 27B Q8_0 + Flash-Next IQ4_XS
  (3-GPU tensor) — `f32/f16/bf16/q8_0/q4_0` generate;
  `q4_1/q5_0/q5_1/iq4_nl` and `k=q4_1 v=bf16` / `k=bf16 v=q4_1` fail
  cleanly (zero asserts, actionable message); layer split + q4_1
  Flash-Next 25.9 t/s (unchanged); qwen4exp derived-cache pool-gate
  byte identity holds (tokens identical with the pool skipped vs
  `GGML_CUDA_QSA_INDEXER_CACHE=1`); dense-27B same-seed coherence A/B
  (gate stripped vs applied on the same tree) byte-identical;
  test-llama-archs qwen4exp all OK (NMSE 1.01e-13).  Canonical fork
  rebuilt at `050dde50c` (am-commits `d65a96084..ce641322e`, block-14
  tip `ce641322e`); set regenerated with `scripts/make-patches.sh`;
  clean-apply sim re-verified 2026-09-08 (14/14 strict `git am`, zero
  whitespace warnings, applied tree == fork tip `ce641322e`, full build
  clean, coherence byte-identical to the validation tree).
 the 2026-09-07 local
  delivery (`9850143`: block-14 **derived-cache pool gate**, regen at
  fork tip `bfcc4be99`) had never been pushed; the 2026-09-08 lineage on
  `origin/main` (issue #18 MUL_MAT_ID pair-fusion layout gate + issue
  #19 moe_weighted_reduction float4 remainder, both folded into blocks
  13/14; the block-14 compiler-warning cleanup; the qwen4exp
  tensor-split HIP gate — regen tip `2f1dc384b`) had been authored from
  a clone without it.  The two block-13/14 regens touched disjoint
  source hunks, so blocks 13/14 now carry all of it: QSA quantized-KV
  decode gate, derived-cache pool gate, the issue-18/19 fixes, the
  warning cleanup and the tensor-split backend gate.  Canonical fork
  rebuilt at `050dde50c` (am-commits `7df708e66..72f0ee944`, block-14
  tip `72f0ee944`); set regenerated with `scripts/make-patches.sh`;
  clean-apply sim re-verified 2026-09-08 (14/14 strict `git am`, zero
  whitespace warnings, applied tree == fork tip `72f0ee944`).
- **Block-14 amendment (2nd) — qwen4exp tensor-split backend gate
  (2026-09-08):** follow-up to the Vulkan validation sweep: block 14
  had removed upstream's `case LLM_ARCH_QWEN4EXP: // TODO: fix
  test-llama-archs` from `llm_arch_supports_sm_tensor`, enabling
  qwen4exp tensor split for every backend.  That is validated on
  ROCm/HIP only (3x R9700, NMSE 9.87e-14 vs CPU); on backends that
  cannot run the fused QSA/HC/WS4 ops on-device (Vulkan, Metal, SYCL;
  NVIDIA CUDA untested) the CPU-fallback subgraphs leave the meta
  splitter unable to reconcile mirrored-vs-split operand states and it
  aborts at graph reserve (`ggml-backend-meta.cpp` `handle_generic`,
  e.g. the qwen4exp gated-attention `MUL` on Vulkan — `test-llama-archs`
  died at the qwen4exp Meta row).  The enablement is now `#ifdef
  GGML_USE_HIP`, restoring upstream's clean "not implemented" error /
  arch-test SKIP on all other builds.  Verified: Vulkan — full
  test-llama-archs sweep completes RC=0 (457 rows, statuses identical
  to upstream 050dde50c, qwen4exp Meta SKIP like upstream), qwen4exp
  single-device still OK (9.01e-08, roundtrip OK), llama-cli
  qwen4exp `-sm tensor` fails with the upstream message; HIP —
  qwen4exp Meta still OK 9.87e-14 (validated path unchanged).  Canonical
  fork rebuilt at `050dde50c`; block-14 tip `13719e3ca` →
  `2f1dc384b`; set regenerated; clean-apply sim re-verified (14/14
  `git am`, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree == fork tip).
- **Block-14 amendment — compiler-warning cleanup (2026-09-08):** the
  block-14 sources warned under the `build-llama-vulkan` (system clang
  16.2.1, `-Wall -Wextra`) and `build-llama-rocm-714` (ROCm clang)
  host builds.  Five warnings, all from block-14 code, fixed and
  folded into the block-14 commit:
  - `ggml.c` — unused `n_blocks` local in the `ggml_indexer_fill`
    builder (removed).
  - `ggml-cpu.c` — `-Wswitch`: the exhaustive CPU compute-forward
    switch had no case labels for the new `GGML_OP_INDEXER_SCORE` /
    `GGML_OP_INDEXER_FILL` ops (GPU-only fused ops; the CPU plan
    phase already aborts on them as "op not implemented" before
    compute, so the case is an unreachable `GGML_ABORT`, mirroring
    `GGML_OP_COUNT`).
  - `ggml-cpu/ops.cpp` — two `-Wunreachable-code-break` warnings: the
    `break` after the noreturn `GGML_ABORT("fatal error")` in the
    `HC_MIX`/`HC_COMBINE` CPU type dispatchers' default cases
    (dropped, matching upstream convention).
  - `qwen4exp.cpp` — `idx_cache` was narrowed to `bool`, making the
    documented `GGML_CUDA_QSA_INDEXER_CACHE=2` debug probe
    (`idx_cache != 2`) tautologically true (`-Wtautological-constant-
    out-of-range-compare`); restored to an `int` with the 0/1/2
    tri-state so probe-2 (pool read without the fill) is reachable
    again.  `-Wsign-compare` in the gfx-id sniff loop (`size_t`
    counter vs `ggml_backend_dev_count()`).
  No generated-code or runtime-behavior change in default configs.
  Verified: the four TUs compile warning-free with the exact
  build-vulkan flags; full Vulkan + ROCm 7.14 (gfx1201) builds clean
  on the re-applied sim tree.  Canonical fork rebuilt at `050dde50c`;
  block-14 tip moved `3529b3497` → `13719e3ca`; set regenerated
  (14/14 `git am`, zero whitespace warnings, applied tree
  byte-identical to the fork tip); `rdna-boosts-all.patch` refreshed.
- **Block-14 amendment — MUL_MAT_ID pair-fusion layout gate (2026-09-08,
  issue #18):** community report + detailed root-cause analysis by
  `briansp2020` (production single-R9700 deployment of the 14-block
  set, ROCm 10): the block-13/14 MUL_MAT_ID gate+up pair fusion
  aborted the process with `GGML_ASSERT(ne11 == 1 && n_expert_used > 1)`
  in `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q_pair` whenever two MUL_MAT_ID nodes shared
  src1/ids in a layout the fused kernel does not express (src1->ne[1] > 1
  or top-1 routing) — `test-backend-ops -b ROCm0` died in the
  MUL_MAT_VEC_FUSION group.  The dispatcher gate now requires the
  callee's layout preconditions; such pairs fall back to the per-node
  path, and the qwen4exp sparse-MoE pair (standard layout) still fuses.
- **Block-13 amendment — moe_weighted_reduction float4 remainder fix
  (2026-09-08, issue #19):** community report by `briansp2020`: the
  2026-09-06 mwr-float4 fold dropped the last `n_embd % 4` columns of
  every output row for `n_embd % 4 != 0` (silent wrong output;
  `MOE_WEIGHTED_REDUCTION(n_embd=63, ...)` failed).  The float4 quad
  kernel is now gated to `n_embd % 4 == 0` (where it is also
  alignment-safe) and the upstream scalar bounds-checked kernel covers
  the rest; the aligned path is byte-unchanged.
  Both fixes validated here (3x R9700 gfx1201, ROCm 7.14):
  `test-backend-ops -b ROCm0` **16590/16590** with the fusion active,
  MUL_MAT_VEC_FUSION 1265/1265, MOE_WEIGHTED_REDUCTION 6/6, same-seed
  llama-cli streams byte-identical (Flash-Next IQ4_XS 3-GPU and dense
  27B single-GPU; default vs `GGML_PAIR_OFF=1`/`GGML_PAIR_DENSE_OFF=1`),
  prefill A/B confirms the pair fusion still fires (pp2048/pp8192
  default > pair-off beyond noise), Flash-Next full model runs clean on
  CPU (`-ngl 0`).  Fork tip moved `3529b3497`; set regenerated;
  clean-apply sim re-verified (14/14 `git am`, zero whitespace
  warnings).  Full record:
  [`patches/README.md`](patches/README.md).
- **Block-14 amendment — QSA quantized-KV decode gate (2026-09-07):** a
  quantized KV cache type (e.g. `--cache-type-k q8_0`) aborted qwen4exp
  context init (`GGML_ASSERT` in `ggml_indexer_fill`: the fused decode
  indexer ops read raw cache rows in F32/BF16/F16 only, but the indexer
  sub-cache shares the main `--cache-type-k`).  `build_qsa_top_k` now
  falls back to the per-op chain for quantized indexer keys.  Validated
  on Strix Halo across the full KV-type matrix f32/f16/bf16/q8_0/
  q4_0/q4_1/iq4_nl/q5_0/q5_1 (start + generate, zero errors; BF16 fused
  path unregressed).  Fork tip moved `60aa4173d`; set regenerated.
- **Block-08 amendment — PR #15 integrated (2026-09-07):** community
  report + fix by DanoPTT (single R9700, production since 2026-09-07):
  block 08's mul_mat+bias fusion through a view node handed the
  mmvq/mmvf kernels a destination whose shape the guards never checked
  (a reshape moves tokens between dimensions on multi-sequence
  batches) → `GGML_ASSERT(ids || dst->ne[1] == 1)` abort.  Fix folded
  into the block-08 commit (delivery convention): require the
  through-view destination to satisfy the kernels' shape constraint
  before fusing.  Fork tip moved `3bebffd6b`; set regenerated;
  verified here (3x R9700): clean-apply sim tree-identical, build
  clean, test-backend-ops 6759/6759, dense same-seed byte-identical
  pre vs post fix, 3-GPU hybrid == RCCL, parallel 2-slot decode clean.
- **Re-baseline to upstream master `050dde50c` + block 14 (2026-09-07):**
  fork point moved from `465e49b9c` to the current master tip (22
  upstream commits; the ggml-cuda-touching ones — `b74f590ea` f16 FA
  divergent-barrier fix #27870, `73ab7599b` branchless Q4_K/Q5_K mmvq
  unpack #26705, `473599738` gfx90c HIP support #26454 — merged in
  disjoint hunks).  The `~/llama.cpp` `rdna-boosts` fork was rebuilt
  from `patches/` via `scripts/apply-all.sh` (13/13 `git am` clean at
  `050dde50c` after one manual block-04 conflict in
  `tests/test-backend-ops.cpp` — upstream LEAKY_RELU perf cases kept
  alongside block 04's) and **block 14 (qwen4exp support) was promoted
  from `beta/qwen4exp`** (fork delta `c261553a1..dd4301fb4`, re-based;
  one manual `common.cuh` conflict — upstream gfx90c APU macros kept
  alongside the block's `GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_GFX1151`).  Set regenerated
  with `scripts/make-patches.sh` (base `050dde50c`, canonical
  am-commits `90a816a68..3bebffd6b`, 14 blocks) and
  `rdna-boosts-all.patch` refreshed (87 files).  Clean-apply sim at
  `050dde50c` re-verified 2026-09-07 (applied tree byte-identical to
  the fork tip).  Full record:
  [`patches/README.md`](patches/README.md).
- **Re-baseline to upstream master `465e49b9c` (2026-09-06):** fork point
  moved from `9cffdcc80` to the current master tip (18 upstream commits
  past the fold-verified base `8b4b3558f`, 57 past the old fork point;
  the ggml-cuda-touching ones — `73a43d1f6` mmid/mmf race fixes #28475,
  `5fdfa6282` GDN l2-norm fix #28068 — merged in disjoint hunks, zero
  conflicts).  The `~/llama.cpp` `rdna-boosts` fork was rebuilt from
  `patches/` via `scripts/apply-all.sh` (13/13 `git am` clean, zero
  whitespace warnings; per-file content check on all 112
  upstream-touched files passed) and the set regenerated with
  `scripts/make-patches.sh` (base `465e49b9c`, canonical am-commits
  `45bf4d291..c261553a1`).  Two prerequisites: the 0044cfe fold had
  stripped the format-patch mail headers from 0002/0004/0008/0013 —
  restored from the pre-fold originals (delivery commit 0610b75) — and
  the block-13 message's fold-amendment trailer was re-dated to the
  fold's true date (tip amended `b4b760eb8` -> `c261553a1`).
  `rdna-boosts-all.patch` refreshed (45 files; was stale at 41,
  pre-fold).  Clean-apply sim at `465e49b9c` re-verified 2026-09-06
  (applied tree byte-identical to the fork tip).  The `qwen4exp` fork
  branch was rebuilt on the new base + the consolidated beta support
  patch (see `beta/qwen4exp/README.md`).
- **Campaign date re-stamp (2026-09-06):** the gfx1151/qwen4exp campaign
  docs had run a week ahead of the real calendar; every
  `wip/`/`beta/`/archive date (filenames + text) was collapsed onto the
  real git dates (2026-09-05/06) and the moved records' stale
  `benchmarks/2026-09-*` references were repointed at
  `archive/work/wip-archive/qwen4exp/discovery/`.
- **Block-13 RDNA3.0 gate relaxation (2026-09-05, folded into block 13):**
  the fused MoE gate+up+GLU MMQ prefill arm + its `J_max_gate` tile
  caps are now also on RDNA3_0 (gfx1100), validated on a single RX
  7900 XTX (ROCm 7.14) with Qwen3.6-35B-A3B True-Q3_K_M (ub 2048,
  1-GPU pinned): fusion fires, same-seed coherence IDENTICAL fused-on
  vs off, prefill gains pp2048 +9.4% (5405 vs 4939), pp16384 +7.8%

  RDNA4-tuned J caps transfer (uncapping regressed pp2048 5405 -> 4819
  / pp16384 4487 -> 4070, below the 3-op fallback; a Q3_K@96 probe

- **Block-13 MTP regression fixes (2026-09-02, folded into block 13):**
  (1) dense adaptive-MTP collapse (18.3 -> 27.5 t/s) — the mmvq
  item-split/rpb kernel is register-bound at multi-token decode batches
  (ncols 2..8 = the speculative verify step); fixed with a re-added
  pre-block-13 K-split kernel (`mul_mat_vec_q_ksplit`) for those batches
  and long-K single-token rows (plain decode 29.0 -> 30.1, output
  bit-identical to the 12-block build).  (2) MoE adaptive-MTP collapse
  (draft acceptance 0/1527, 53 t/s vs plain 90) — the block-08
  rms_norm->mmvq Q8_1 quantize-cache fold corrupts multi-token MUL_MAT_ID,
  so verify logits diverge from single-token decode; the fold is now gated
  to single-token MMID + plain MUL_MAT consumers (acceptance 0 -> 0.51,
  MTP 126 t/s vs upstream ~113).  MoE MTP had no baseline data, which is
  why it slipped.  Details + verification: `patches/README.md` block-13
  notes.  The adaptive-MTP baseline gate and expectations now live in
  [`benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md`](benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md)
  — run Protocol A there before shipping decode/fusion changes.
- **Fork tip:** the fork block-12 commit was amended 2026-09-04 with the
  runtime NCCL-failure fallback (issue #13); block 13 was amended
  2026-09-02 with the two MTP regression fixes, 2026-09-05 with the
  RDNA3.5 (Strix Halo) then RDNA3.0 (gfx1100) fused-MoE-MMQ gate
  relaxations and 2026-09-06 with the model-neutral Strix MoE mmq
  folds.  The set was regenerated 2026-09-06 from a canonical fork
  rebuilt at `465e49b9c` (13 am-commits, block-13 tip
  `c261553a1`); the clean-apply sim at `465e49b9c` applies with zero
  conflicts/whitespace warnings and its tree is byte-identical to the
  fork tip.
- **Fork point (baseline):** llama.cpp master at `465e49b9c` (re-based
  2026-09-06 from `9cffdcc80`, itself re-based 2026-09-02 from

  IDENTICAL (hybrid vs RCCL, 3-GPU) on the rebuilt fork; the clean-apply
  sim at `465e49b9c` applies with zero conflicts/whitespace warnings and
  its tree is byte-identical to the fork tip (`c261553a1`; 2026-09-06
  regeneration — earlier regenerations were re-verified on the RX 7900
  XTX box with sim build coherence identical + perf reproduced). tg64
  38.12 / tg512 41.08 and the block-13 numbers are unchanged — the
  re-base is content-identical plus upstream's additions.
- **Whitespace-clean apply:** the regenerated set applies with **zero git
  whitespace warnings** (`git am` 01-13; re-verified 2026-09-02 on a
  fresh checkout at `9cffdcc80`, re-verified 2026-09-04 after the
  block-12 amendment, re-verified 2026-09-05 after the block-13 RDNA3.5
  gate relaxation and again after the RDNA3.0/gfx1100 fold,
  re-verified 2026-09-06 on the `465e49b9c` re-base).
- **Deployment:** 3-GPU hybrid (`HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2`, unpinned) gives
  depth-16384 decode 38.71 t/s (+21.8% vs 2-GPU). See
  [`patches/README.md`](patches/README.md) for block-12 env knobs and the
  server config.
- **RDNA4-only gate:** block 12 refuses to init off gfx1200/gfx1201 and
  falls back to RCCL (community RDNA3 verification pending).
- **Runtime NCCL-failure fallback (2026-09-04, issue #13):** block 12 no
  longer aborts when NCCL/RCCL fails at runtime — on the first failure it
  clears the sticky HIP errors on each AR device, warns once, stops using
  NCCL for the rest of the run and re-routes AllReduce to the internal
  pipeline (or the meta backend's butterfly).  This covers RCCL >= 2.30.4
  refusing kernel dispatch on a PCIe root port without AtomicOp completer
  support (e.g. PCH/Z390; `ncclCommInitAll` succeeds — see
  ROCm/ROCm#6520).  Folded into the block-12 commit; re-verified
  2026-09-04 (clean-apply sim, build, same-seed coherence IDENTICAL pre
  vs post fix on 27B Q8_0, depth-16384 tg unregressed: 2-GPU 32.48 ->
  32.40, 3-GPU 39.33 -> 39.31).
- **Block-12 AR_PROFILE fix (2026-09-01, PR #8):** AR-profile `devices[]`
  init order fixed — `GGML_CUDA_AR_PROFILE=1` no longer faults GPU 1
  under MTP (pre-fix reproduced on 3x R9700; post-fix clean, profiler
  dumps on every device).  Regenerated into the set; coherence unchanged.
- **Block-02 MTP chunked-GDN prefix (2026-09-01, PR #9):** block 02 now
  runs its chunked WMMA GDN on long single-sequence MTP prefills (prefix
  `n_tokens-K` + sequential K-tail) — +7.5% prefill at ~5.5k prompt,
  +7.7% at ~38k on 3x R9700, 64-token same-seed output token-identical
  to sequential.  Opt out: `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0`.
