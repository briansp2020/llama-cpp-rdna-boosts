# ENVIRONMENT.md — environment variables that affect this repo

Scope: everything **this repo adds or repurposes**, plus the upstream variables and the non-ggml
runtime variables (HIP/ROCm) that materially affect how this delivery behaves.  Defaults are taken from
the `rdna-boosts` tree at release `v16-a55e952b8-r35`; the table was generated from the code, not from
memory (see [Maintaining this file](#maintaining-this-file)).

## How to read this

| class | meaning |
|---|---|
| **Kill-switch** | the feature is **ON by default** because it passed its gate; the variable exists to disable it for A/B, bisection or a workaround. Setting it to `0` restores the old behaviour. |
| **Opt-in** | OFF by default; the feature is not gated or not for production. |
| **Tuning** | takes a number/string; the default is the validated value. |
| **Diagnostic** | no effect on the default path — it only logs, dumps, or gates a debug helper. Never set in production. |

Two idioms are used in the code and they are **not** interchangeable:

* *presence-only*: `getenv("X") != nullptr` — **any** value (including `0`) enables it.
* *value-gated*: `getenv("X") != nullptr && atoi(...)` — `1` enables, `0` leaves it off.

The tables below say which one each variable uses, because guessing wrong is a classic time sink.

## The short answer: what you actually need

**Nothing.** Every feature the delivery ships is default-on, and this is deliberate policy (see
`AGENTS.md`, "Default-on policy"). You do **not** need to set anything for the recommended server or
`llama-cli` invocation. The variables below exist to *disable* things, to bisect a regression, or to
tune a value that has a validated default.

The only ones worth knowing by heart:

| variable | default | why you would touch it |
|---|---|---|
| `GGML_COMPUTE_BUFFER_MARGIN_PCT` | `10` (HIP only) | `0` disables the compute-buffer slack — the fastest way to reproduce the old TODO #42 abort |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB` | unset = auto | `0` disables the MoE expert cache entirely (CPU expert path) |
| `GGML_CUDA_SLAB` | **on** | `0` disables the movable-boundary slab allocator (back to per-allocation `cudaMalloc`; reintroduces the TODO #42 server abort).  Since **r37** the slab is additionally **armed only for models with host-resident experts** (`-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` > 0); a dense model never creates one |
| `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_HEADROOM_MIB` | `4096` | VRAM left outside the slab after it reclaims the unused reserve. **Raising it buys steady-state margin at the cost of arena**; `2048` aborts the 16k path inside hipBLASLt |
| `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE` | `hybrid` | force `internal` \| `nccl` \| `ce` for multi-GPU A/B |
| `LLAMA_DROP_COMPUTE_BUFFERS` | **on for every tool** | `0` keeps the wide-prefill layout (smaller arena). Under the slab a later wide prefill reclaims it via a boundary move, so a server may drop too |
| `GGML_CUDA_OP_TIMING` | off | per-op GPU timing/profiling |

---

## 1. Compute buffers and the MoE arena

### 1.1 `GGML_COMPUTE_BUFFER_MARGIN_PCT` — **tuning**, default `10`, HIP/ROCm only

Pads every **compute** buffer allocation by that percentage (`ggml-alloc.c`, via the buffer type's
`get_compute_margin_pct`).  The graph allocator sizes the compute buffer from a *measure* graph, but a
runtime graph can carry a different live-tensor set (host-expert staging, MTP taps) and need a little
more — measured +3.3 %.  Growing it is a free-then-allocate-larger, so it needs a contiguous block
**bigger than the one just released**, which fails once the free VRAM belongs to the MoE arena.  Taking
the slack up front moves the cost to before the arena is sized.

* `0` disables it — and **reproduces the original abort**, so it is the natural A/B control.
* Cost, measured on 2× R9700 (`-sm tensor -ncmoe 48`): 1275 MiB of arena residency (63.8 % → 61.5 %),
  ≈127 MiB per percentage point.
* Only the RDNA/ROCm path opts in (`#if defined(GGML_USE_HIP)`); every other backend's allocation sizes
  are unchanged.  Read once per process.
* **Unchanged in r37:** the margin still applies to dense models (about 10 % of a now-small layout).  Only
  the **chunk** is slab-gated (`GGML_COMPUTE_BUFFER_CHUNK_MIB`); together with the r37 host-expert slab gate
  this is what restores a dense model's pre-slab compute-buffer sizes (issue #120).
* Compute-only: model weights, the KV cache and the arena are untouched.

### 1.2 MoE expert-cache arena

| variable | default | class | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB` | unset = **auto** | tuning | sizes each device from its free VRAM. `0` disables the cache **completely** (CPU expert path) — prefer this over a tiny arena, which stands the cache-aware MoE fusions down and is ~8× slower than the cache-less path. |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_RESERVE_MIB` | `1024` | tuning | VRAM held back from the arena for the compute side / KV cache.  The old server workaround raised this to `8192`; **that is no longer needed** (the r20 slack + the fail-soft yield cover it). |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIN_MIB` | `0` | tuning | auto-sizing floor; below it the cache declines itself instead of building a useless arena.  Decided **early** (before the context exists, i.e. before any graph) since r24 -- a late `g_enabled = false` would plan the MTP draft and the target with different kernels.  If a config still trips it late, it logs an ERROR and keeps the small arena (correct, slower). |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIN_RES_PCT` | `18` when auto | tuning | minimum residency worth keeping.  Live since r24 (it was silently inert while the early floor never ran). |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_AUX_RESERVE_MIB` | unset | tuning | extra reserve for auxiliary buffers. |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_SLOTS` | `0` | tuning | explicit slot count hint (0 = derive from the budget). |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_PERIOD` | `32` | tuning | promotion/rebalance period, in tokens. |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_FILL` | `1` | kill-switch | fill-on-miss. |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_TOUCH` | `2` | tuning | `admit=touch`: uses since last resident before a fill is allowed. |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_DEVMAP` | `1` | kill-switch | device-side remap (builds the slot remap on the device). |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_DEVPOLICY` | `1` | kill-switch | device-side admission policy. |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_DEVPOLICY_SPLIT` | unset | tuning | split-policy variant. |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_KSLOT` | `1` | kill-switch | resolve the slot map in the MoE ids consumer instead of a materialized remap buffer. |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_PROVISIONAL` | `1` | kill-switch | provisional eviction during a pass. |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_PREFILL_SEED` | `1` | kill-switch | seed the cache during prefill. |
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_PREFILL_SEED_N` | `0` | tuning | how many prefill seeds (0 = default). |
| `GGML_MOE_CACHE_MAX_TOK` | device MMVQ band (16 on RDNA4; 8 on RDNA3, NVIDIA) | kill-switch | caps the expert-cache **decode/verify band** (routed `MUL_MAT_ID` tokens the cache serves from the arena).  It defaults to the routed-expert MMVQ kernel's own band on the device since r31; `8` restores the pre-r31 band (band widening in `archive/work/moe-cache-band16/`).  A non-numeric value silently yields 1. |
| `GGML_MOE_GATHER_ONCE` | off | diagnostic | gather each expert once per pass. |

> The arena is the **lowest-priority** VRAM consumer: without a slab, any device allocation that runs short
> frees the largest table (then the whole arena) and retries.  With the slab on (the default, see §1.3) that
> path is *skipped* — freeing a table cannot return bytes to the driver once the slab owns them — and the
> allocation instead fails with a message naming `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_RESERVE_MIB`.  There is no variable for the
> yield behaviour, and it should stay that way.  See `ARENA-UB-TENSION.md` §13/§14.

### 1.2.1 Optional host-expert pool (`--host-experts pool`, block 06)

The pool is an **option** for systems that cannot hold the weights resident; the default `--host-experts
pinned` (and `auto`) keeps the usual behaviour and allocates **no** pool.  When enabled, it is a bounded
pinned bounce buffer over the page cache, one per host tensor, process-wide budget, and it serves the MoE
expert-cache fills.  r35.

| variable / flag | default | class | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--host-experts pool` | `pinned` | option | select the bounded host pool.  `pinned`/`auto` = no pool; `mmap` was removed in r33. |
| `MOE_HOST_POOL_MIB` | `auto` | tuning | pool size when enabled: unset/`auto` = `MOE_HOST_POOL_FRAC` % of the MoE host expert bytes (`moe_host_expert_bytes`); `N` = explicit MiB; `0` = disable even with `--host-experts pool`. |
| `MOE_HOST_POOL_FRAC` | `25` | tuning | the auto percentage (1–100). |
| `MOE_HOST_POOL_POLICY` | `1` | kill-switch | pooled tables on the device policy: `1` pool-aware fill, `0` host promotion (pre-r35), `2` master fill (A/B). |
| `MOE_HOST_POOL_PREFETCH` | `0` | opt-in | routing-driven speculative pool prefill; **off** because a long-prompt sweep showed it hurts until the pool nears full residency (`1` enables). |
| `MOE_HOST_POOL_PREWARM` | `1` | kill-switch | one-shot slot fill when a pool is built (ranked by the prefill tally / arena residents). |
| `MOE_HOST_POOL_BGFETCH` | `1` | kill-switch | low-priority background eviction prefetch; `0` is the synchronous path. |
| `MOE_HOST_POOL_DIO` | `0` | diagnostic | `1` = O_DIRECT fill (bypasses the page cache). |

### 1.3 The movable-boundary slab (block 06) — `GGML_CUDA_SLAB`, default **on**

**This is the delivery's central allocator.**  ONE slab per device is reserved and mapped **exactly once**
(`cuMemAddressReserve` + one `cuMemMap`), then split by a movable **boundary**: the work pool (the compute
buffer) below it, the MoE arena above it.  Growing the work region is a *boundary move inside the
already-mapped slab* — the lowest arena chunks change owner and the tables living there are evicted — so
**HIP is not called at runtime** and the work region's base VA never moves (a growing layout keeps every
tensor address).  It replaces the per-allocation VMM pool (`GGML_CUDA_COMPUTE_VMM`, **removed**) and the
"chunk the compute buffer so the arena can yield" plan: nothing is ever unmapped, so the ROCm sub-range
`hipMemUnmap` limitation stops mattering.

| variable | default | class | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GGML_CUDA_SLAB` | **on** | kill-switch | `0` disables the slab.  The plain `cudaMalloc` path returns, together with the pre-slab failure mode (a later wide prefill aborting — the TODO #42 crash). |
| `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_CHUNK_MIB` | `64` | tuning | the boundary-move granularity (must be a power of two).  Arena *allocations* use the finer VMM granularity (2 MiB), so this does not waste arena. |
| `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_RESERVE_MIB` | `max(8192, 25 % of the device)` | tuning | left OUTSIDE the slab for the weights / KV / draft / workspaces.  This is a **hard** constraint: ROCm will not unmap a sub-range of the slab's single mapping, so a value too small ENDS THE RUN (measured: 4096 -> a failed hipBLASLt workspace, exit 134). |
| `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_MIN_ARENA_MIB` | `2048` | tuning | hard cache floor: the slab is created only if it fits `estimated work buffer + this`.  Otherwise it declines, logs an error and the cache STREAMS from the host (`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=0` semantics). |
| `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_HEADROOM_MIB` | `4096` (or `6144` under `-sm layer` with host experts, r36) | tuning | how much stays free outside the slab when `slab_extend` reclaims the reserve the model did not need.  **Not slack**: it must cover every allocation made after that point, including ones we cannot redirect (see below).  `0` disables the reclaim.  Since r36 the MoE cache asks for at least **6144** when every cache table is unsplit and the tables span more than one device (`ggml_cuda_slab_headroom_at_least_mib`); the 255k `-sm layer -ts 59,41` run OOMed at 4096 and passes at 6144.  An explicit value still wins. |
| `GGML_CUDA_POOL_MIN_FREE_MIB` | `512` when the cache holds host-expert tables, else `0` | tuning / kill-switch | r36.  The workspace pool's **first** attempt refuses like a real OOM when it would leave less than this much VRAM free, so its existing flush + retry runs instead.  The retry has no floor, so it never aborts.  `0` disables the floor. |
| `GGML_CUDA_OPTIONAL_ALLOC_MAX_FREE_PCT` | `50` | tuning / kill-switch | caps an **optional** raw allocation — the op-offload H2D staging ring (issue #117) and the FA prefill staging arena — at this percentage of the device's *free* VRAM.  A refusal is graceful: the ring falls back to the serial path, the FA staging to the native K/V read (one-time warning).  `0` restores the pre-change unbounded behaviour.  **Inert unless the slab is active on the device**, so a non-host-expert / non-ROCm run is unchanged; it is a cap, never a reservation.  `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MAX_MB` remains the hard ring override. |
| `GGML_COMPUTE_BUFFER_CHUNK_MIB` | `256` | tuning | the compute buffer is allocated in whole chunks + one spare (`(ceil(need/C)+1)*C`), so growth inside the chunk is free.  `0` falls back to `GGML_COMPUTE_BUFFER_MARGIN_PCT`.  Since **r37** the chunk applies **only when the slab is in use**: a dense model (no slab) falls back to the percentage margin, which removes the +739 MiB of issue #120. |

**Why the cards sit near-full.**  `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_HEADROOM_MIB` is what is free *at the moment the slab is
extended*, and the steady state is that minus everything allocated afterwards — measured ~3.7 GiB of it: the
MTP draft buffer (762 MiB), the FA-QSA workspace (762 MiB), hipBLASLt's Tensile code objects and internal
workspace, and the workspace-pool high-water mark.  So ~200-350 MiB free is normal, and raising the headroom
raises it one-for-one (8192 -> ~4.3 GiB free) at the cost of an equal amount of arena.

> **Do not disable hipBLASLt to buy headroom.**  The ROCm BLAS stack allocates its own Tensile code objects
> and workspace behind the application's back, and that class of allocation CANNOT be routed into the slab.
> Measured with `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0` at `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_HEADROOM_MIB=2048`: the output was CORRUPT
> (`////`), and at 4096 a 16k request returned one token then EOS.  It is not a supported configuration.

## 2. Scheduler and H2D staging (block 06)

The whole-shard H2D staging path for host-resident MoE expert tables.  Defaults below are the validated
configuration.

| variable | default | class | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GGML_SCHED_STAGE` | on | kill-switch (value) | master switch for the staging path. |
| `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MODE` | unset | tuning | staging mode; the delivery uses the `stage_d2d` form (redirect is corruption-prone). |
| `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MIN_TOKENS` | `64` | tuning | width gate floor.  Below it the copy loop's gather branch serves the input instead. |
| `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_SLOTS` | unset | tuning | ring slot count. |
| `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MAX_MB` | unset | tuning | hard ring budget cap; the slab-gated free-VRAM cap `GGML_CUDA_OPTIONAL_ALLOC_MAX_FREE_PCT` (§1.3) also applies to a growth. |
| `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_TABLE_REF_MB` | `0` | tuning | `0` = width-only gate (r18 disabled the stale r7 table-size scaling; a positive value restores it for A/B). |
| `GGML_SCHED_EVENTS` | on | kill-switch | set `0` to drop the cross-device event ordering. This was the pre-r12 workaround for the `-sm layer` + host-expert garbage-prefill bug; it is **fixed** in block 06, so leave it on. |
| `GGML_SCHED_DEVGATHER` | on | kill-switch | device-gather path. |
| `GGML_SCHED_SYNC_GRAPH_INPUTS` | on | kill-switch | extra graph-input sync. |
| `GGML_SCHED_DEBUG` | unset | diagnostic | scheduler debug output. |
| `GGML_SCHED_DEBUG_REALLOC` | unset | diagnostic | log buffer reallocations. |
| `GGML_META_SPLIT_COPY` | unset | tuning | meta-backend split copy handling. |
| `GGML_META_SS_VERIFY` | off | diagnostic | `1` recomputes every outermost meta split-state cache hit and aborts on a stale entry (r25 added the 8-version + compacted cache; this verifies it). |
| `GGML_STAGE_META_REDIRECT` | off | diagnostic | meta redirection instead of the explicit d2d completion. |
| `GGML_STAGE_NO_RESTORE` | off | diagnostic | skip the redirect restore (debug only — unsafe). |
| `GGML_STAGE_GATHER_SCRATCH` | off | diagnostic | force the gather scratch path. |
| `GGML_MOE_CACHE_INPLACE` | on | kill-switch | r36.  With `-ncmoe` host experts, `0` keeps the cache-aware staging copy (arena + host, one kernel) instead of reading the routed table in place. |
| `GGML_MOE_CACHE_STAGE` | on | kill-switch | r36.  `0` restores the plain whole-table upload (pre-r36 behaviour, the full staging copy). |

---

## 3. MTP / speculative decoding

| variable | default | class | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MTP_DRAFT_N_UBATCH` | `512` | tuning | caps the MTP draft's encoder-injection chunk.  The draft only drafts `n_max+1` tokens, so a 512-token chunk is plenty, and the ~1.6 GiB/device the wide chunk held at `-ub 8192` goes to the MoE arena.  `0` restores the target's `-ub` (no cap); a tiny cap (e.g. 4) costs prefill speed. |
| `LLAMA_SPEC_DRAFT_N_MAX_CLAMP` | `1` = clamp on | kill-switch | clamps `--spec-draft-n-max` to 15 (the recurrent snapshot bound). `0` escapes the clamp; **purity is only promised to 7**. |
| `LLAMA_MTP_DRAFT_OP_OFFLOAD` | unset | tuning | op-offload behaviour for the draft model. |
| `LLAMA_MTP_SPARSE` / `LLAMA_MTP_SPARSE_DECODE` | unset | tuning | sparse MTP variants. |
| `GGML_LF_DFLASH_DEV` | **on** (single sequence) | kill-switch | DFlash device-resident layer-input features (F1).  `0` uses the host path.  Default-on since r26; if the device buffers cannot be allocated the target warns once and stays on the host path for the rest of the context.  Multi-sequence always uses the host path. |

The tuned adaptive-MTP controller is selected with **`--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive`** (a CLI flag, not
an environment variable).  Plain `--spec-type draft-mtp` does not use it.

---

## 4. Model loading and context

| variable | default | class | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS` | — | **removed (r33)** | the legacy alias for `--host-experts`.  The pageable `--host-experts mmap` mode was dropped in r33 (issue #116): a no-XNACK GPU (gfx1201 reports `XNACK enabled: NO`) cannot read a pageable host master in a kernel, so `-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` experts are always pinned (`ROCm_Host`).  The variable is now ignored.  The bounded pinned DIO host tier that replaces the reclaimable-page-cache idea is the `archive/work/host-expert-dio-cache/` campaign. |
| `LLAMA_TENSOR_HOST_BUFT` | unset | tuning | host buffer type for overridden tensors. |
| `LLAMA_DEVICE_INPUT` | off | **opt-in** | device-side input handling. |
| `LLAMA_DROP_COMPUTE_BUFFERS` | **on** (every tool) | tuning / kill-switch | drop the wide-prefill compute layout at the prefill→decode transition so a wide `-ub` and a large arena coexist (`-ub 8192` cache-auto cli decode 45.6 → 78.7 t/s).  Follows `common_params::drop_compute_buffers`; set the env to `0`/`1` to override.  **A server may drop too** (this was cli-only until r22): the movable-boundary slab reclaims a later wide layout with a boundary move, which is verified on `wide1 → short → wide2` at `-ub 8192` (0 aborts, all coherent).  `0` is only needed where the compute layout CANNOT be reclaimed — i.e. with `GGML_CUDA_SLAB=0`. |
| `LLAMA_DROP_EXTRA_RESERVE_MIB` | `0` | tuning | when the drop fires, VRAM held out of the arena per device for a later compute growth.  Default `0` — the compute-buffer margin covers the small post-drop growth and the arena's layer-uniform re-size absorbs fragmentation, so a reserve only costs arena. |
| `LLAMA_LAZY_BUF_MB` / `LLAMA_LAZY_IO_THREADS` / `LLAMA_LAZY_READER_STATS` | unset | tuning / diagnostic | lazy-mode buffer size, reader thread count, reader statistics. |
| `LLAMA_KV_N_PAD_MIN` | `256` | tuning (**opt-in**) | raises the n_kv padding floor (r25).  n_kv is padded to this many cells, so a larger value keeps the per-device tensor-split graphs constant for longer (the PR measured `1024` as the useful value, `4096` gave nothing more).  Default unchanged. |

---

## 5. CPU MoE offload threading

| variable | default | class | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GGML_CPU_MOE_OFFLOAD_THREADS` | derived (block-06 cap) | tuning | overrides the thread cap for `-ncmoe` offloaded-MoE decode.  The cap only covers that case. |
| `GGML_CPU_DISABLE_TINY_GRAPH_SINGLE_THREAD` | off | diagnostic | disables the single-thread path for tiny graphs. |

Thread sizing is **not** an environment variable and is not optional: `/usr/local/bin/pin_gpu_irqs.sh`
puts the GPU IRQs on the top `NUM_GPUS` cores, and the default `-t` puts the worker pool there and
starves the GPU.  Size `-t` (or `--cpu-mask` with `-t` inside the mask) to leave those cores free.
See `AGENTS.md`.

---

## 6. Multi-GPU comms

| variable | default | class | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE` | `hybrid` on Linux | tuning | `hybrid` (NCCL for large, internal for small) \| `internal` \| `nccl` \| `ce` (SDMA copy-engine, 2 GPU).  Unrecognised values warn and fall through to the platform default.  `nccl` is **not** bit-identical under `-sm tensor` (the internal AR BF16-round-trips), so use it as a smoke comparison only. |
| `GGML_CUDA_P2P` | off | tuning | enables peer access.  Note VMM allocations need explicit `cuMemSetAccess` for P2P (see `FOLLOWUP-compute-arena-chunking.md`). |

---

## 7. Fusion A/B switches

Each of these disables exactly one optimization so it can be bisected.  **The feature is on by default;
the variable turns it off.**  Read the idiom column carefully — setting a presence-only switch to `0`
still disables the feature.

**The fusions are ON, and stay ON.**  The one known stand-down path — the cache-aware guard against
per-table slab eviction (`TODO.md` #50, evidence in `wip/slab-ring-region/FINDINGS-numerics.md` F3) — is a
pre-existing property of the arena, not a reason to turn them off.  Measured on the field config
(Qwen3.8-Flash-Next IQ4_NL, `-sm tensor -ncmoe 48`, 32 358-token prompt, `--spec-type none`, warm):

| | prefill t/s | decode t/s |
|---|---:|---:|
| fusions on (default) | 945-972 | 61.3-65.2 |
| `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_FUSION=1` | 845-890 | 57.5-65.3 |

so a full disable costs **~9-10 % prefill and ~6 % decode**, and the fusion-off prefill (845-890) is
*below* the unpatched stock reference (922) — it gives back the delivery's prefill win.

**To restore the full speed** after an A/B or a debug recipe, make sure none of the switches below is set:
unset `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_FUSION` and the rest of §7.2/§7.3, and unset (or `=1`) every `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_*` in
§7.1.  A clean environment is already the full-speed configuration — there is nothing to add, only
switches to remove.  (`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_FUSION=1` is a **sledgehammer**: it also skips the
`graph_optimize` alloc-dependency pass and its shared-expert node reorder, so its cost is not the cost of
any single fusion.)

### 7.1 `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_*` — presence of the variable with a value, `0` disables

`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_ADD_RMS_Q8`, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH`, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GATE_BETA_VERIFY`,
`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GDN_BETA_SIGMOID`, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GDN_CONV_VERIFY`, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GDN_GATE`,
`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GLU_Q8_1`, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_HC_COMBINE_MIX`, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_Q8_1_VERIFY`,
`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_SIGMOID_MUL_ADD`, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_SWIGLU_MMQ`.
These use `getenv(...) == nullptr || atoi(...) != 0`, so unset = **on** and `0` = off.
(Git history note: these were originally *opt-in* `=1` switches; they are now default-on kill-switches.)

The same idiom — and therefore also default-on despite the name — covers
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_IDX_RELU_SUM` and `GGML_CUDA_CONCAT_VERIFY`.

### 7.2 `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_*` — value-gated (`=1` disables, `0` keeps it on)

`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_FUSED_ADDMUL`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_FUSION`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_GDN_CPY`,
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_HC_FUSION`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_L2_NORM_PAIR`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MOE_DOWN_FOLD`,
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MOE_MMQ_FUSION`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MWR`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_NORM_Q8_1`,
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_NORM_ROWS`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_ROPE_SETROWS`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SCALE_UNARY`,
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SHEXP_DOWN_GATE`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SNAKE`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SSM_CONV_IN`,
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SSM_PRESCAN`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_WEIGHTED_DOWN`.

`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SHEXP_DOWN_GATE=1` is the A/B switch for the byte-identical fused shared-expert band
(`1 <= nt <= 8`).

### 7.3 `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_*` — **presence-only** (any value, including `0`, disables)

`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_CONV_FUSION`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MMID_512`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MMQ_ROUTED`,
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MMVQ_DENSE_BAND`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_MMVQ_MOE_BAND`,
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_RMS_NORM_MUL_ROPE`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_ROPE_SET_ROWS`,
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_TOPK_MOE_FUSION`.

### 7.4 Other kernel tuning

| variable | default | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GGML_CUDA_MMQ_J_MAX` | tuning | MMQ `J` tile width cap. |
| `GGML_Q6_COMPACT_J` | tuning | Q6 compact-`J` variant. |
| `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_RDNA3_5_SINGLE_TOKEN_FUSIONS` | off (**opt-in**, RDNA3.5 only) | the qwen4exp weighted-down single-token chain. |
| `GGML_PAIR_OFF` / `GGML_PAIR_DENSE_OFF` / `GGML_PAIR_2X` | off | paired-kernel variants. |
| `GGML_CUDA_SPLICE_GATHER`, `GGML_CUDA_SCALE_UNARY`, `GGML_CUDA_HC_MIX_BAND`, `GGML_CUDA_HC_MIX_PREQ`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_HC_COMB`, `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_HC_MIX`, `LLAMA_FUSED_HC_MIX`, `LLAMA_FUSED_HC_COMBINE`, `LLAMA_FUSED_DSV4_HC_PRE/POST`, `LLAMA_HC_MIX_BF16`, `GGML_CUDA_LIGHTNING_INDEXER4_GFX1100/GFX1201`, `GGML_LF_FAST_TOPK`, `LLAMA_INDEXER_NOBLOCK`, `LLAMA_INDEXER_NOGROUP` | off / default-on | model-specific fused chains. A/B only. |
| `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_VERIFY_GRAPHS`, `GGML_HIP_GRAPH_FORCE_UPDATE` | off | HIP graph-capture controls. |
| `GGML_HC_UP_V2` | on | kill-switch | `0` restores the row-at-a-time BF16 `hc_mix` up/collapse kernel (r27); v2 is bit-identical and 4-21 % faster on the op. |
| `GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_MEM_GEN` | on | kill-switch | `0` disables the per-device graph memory generation (r25): a graph that captured pool temporary / FA-staging / H2D-ring memory freed since is otherwise recaptured. |
| `GGML_CUDA_Q8_1_ARENA_FREE_OLD` | off | kill-switch (**opt-in**) | `1` restores the immediate `cudaFree` of a grown-out Q8_1 input arena (the r24 behaviour, A/B only): captured decode/verify graphs keep pointers into it, so this reintroduces the `quantize_q8_1` page fault. |
| `GGML_CUDA_BF16_SRC1_CACHE` | on | kill-switch | r36.  `0` disables the per-graph reuse of the BF16 copy of a shared F32 src1 across the qwen4exp hc-mixer cuBLAS BF16 GEMMs (prefill only, `>= 64` columns); bit-identical either way. |
| `LLAMA_HC_PIN_BLOCK_OUT` | off | kill-switch (**opt-in**) | `1` restores pinning every qwen4exp layer's `block_out` as a prefill graph output (r24 behaviour; costs ~1.9 GiB of the `-ub 2048` compute buffer). |
| `LLAMA_HC_MIX_PLANAR` | on | kill-switch | `0` restores the interleaved HC_MIX output (r24) instead of the planar layout (r25; BF16 CUDA path only). |
| `LLAMA_CONV_TAIL_CONT` | off | kill-switch (**opt-in**) | `1` restores the `cont` + `cpy` conv-state tail copy instead of the direct strided 2D memcpy (r25). |
| `GGML_FORCE_NO_INTEGRATED` | off | ignore integrated GPUs when picking devices. |

## 8. Flash attention / QSA (qwen4exp)

| variable | default | class | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GGML_HIP_FA_BAND_WIDE` | on | kill-switch | `0` disables the wide band. |
| `GGML_HIP_FA_BAND_WMMA` / `GGML_HIP_FA_BAND_WMMA_SPLIT` | unset | tuning | band kernel selection. |
| `GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_256` / `GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_MAX_HEAD` | unset | tuning | WMMA tile / head caps. |
| `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE` / `GGML_CUDA_FA_MASK_SKIP` | unset | tuning | native-KV and mask-skip paths. |
| `GGML_CUDA_FA_STAGE_MAX_MB` | unset | tuning | FA staging budget. |
| `LLAMA_QSA_OFF` | off | kill-switch | disables QSA. |
| `LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA` | on | kill-switch | `0` = the dense masked path. **This is the QSA oracle**: the `W=1..8` matrix is blind to a width-uniform corruption, so measure the perplexity ratio against `LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0` when touching the QSA op. |
| `LLAMA_QSA_KEYS_ONLY`, `LLAMA_QSA_PLE_HOSTGATHER`, `LLAMA_QSA_DENSE_SHORTCUT`, `LLAMA_QSA_SCORE_BOUNDS`, `LLAMA_QSA_SCORE_STRIP`, `LLAMA_QSA_SCORE_WMMA`, `LLAMA_QSA_SCORE_WMMA_MB`, `GGML_CUDA_QSA_IDENTITY`, `GGML_CUDA_QSA_SLICES`, `GGML_CUDA_QSA3`, `GGML_CUDA_QSA_INDEXER_CACHE`, `GGML_CUDA_QSA_INDEXER_SCORE`, `GGML_QSA_DERIVED_BIAS`, `GGML_QSA_DERIVED_VIS`, `GGML_QSA_SCORE_MEM`, `LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED` | off / unset | tuning | QSA variants and indexer tuning. |

The QSA op has a CPU oracle: `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_QSA` (18/18 minimum).

## 9. GDN / SSM (block 02)

| variable | default | class | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED` | on | kill-switch | compared as a **string** against `"0"` — literally `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0` forces the sequential kernel (correct, bit-identical, slow). The chunked prefill is K-independent with threshold `max(K>16?K:16, n_rs_batch)`. |
| `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED_BF16` | on | kill-switch | BF16/WMMA chunked GDN variant, **default-on since r30** (RDNA3/RDNA4, `S_v == 128` prefill). Near-lossless, not bit-exact (bf16 operands, fp32 accumulation; ~1e-5 op NMSE; prefill mean KLD 0.0007 / 0.00005 / 0.00015 on gfx1201 / gfx1100 / gfx1151, same-top-p >= 98.7 %). `=0` runs the fp32 chunked kernel. r29 had defaulted it off as a workaround for the n_seqs > 1 `A_sc` stride aliasing bug (issue #113), fixed in r30. |
| `GDN_DBG_SKIP_KKT`, `GDN_DBG_SKIP_SCAN` | off | diagnostic | skip stages (debug). |

## 10. MMB (block 08)

The `mmb` campaign is part of the delivery.  `GGML_CUDA_MMB` defaults to `1`; the rest are tuning knobs
for tile/shape selection and cache sizing.  Treat them as internal: the validated configuration is the
default, and they exist to reproduce measurements from `benchmarks/`.

`GGML_CUDA_MMB`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_BF16W`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_CACHE`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_CFG`,
`GGML_CUDA_MMB_DENSE`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_DENSE_TYPES`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_DOWN16`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_F32SPLIT`,
`GGML_CUDA_MMB_F32SPLIT_MIN_K`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_F32SPLIT_MIN_M`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_GLU`,
`GGML_CUDA_MMB_GLU_THRESH`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_HC16`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_IQ3XXS`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_MIN_T`,
`GGML_CUDA_MMB_RDNA3`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_ROUTED`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_ROUTED_THRESH`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_SHADOW`,
`GGML_CUDA_MMB_SHADOW_MB`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_TALL`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_TALL_MIN_M`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_TILE`,
`GGML_CUDA_MMB_TINY_M`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_TINY_TT`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_TYPES`, `GGML_CUDA_MMB_LOG`,
`GGML_CUDA_MMB_MARK_LOG`, `LLAMA_MMB_CVT_LOG`, `LLAMA_MMB_F32SPLIT`, `LLAMA_HC_BLK16`,
`LLAMA_HC_GATEMIX`, `LLAMA_HC_RES16`.

## 11. Diagnostics and profiling

None of these change the computed result on the default path.

| variable | notes |
|---|---|
| `GGML_CUDA_OP_TIMING` | per-op GPU timing. |
| `GGML_CUDA_GCDBG` | CUDA-graph debug. |
| `GGML_STREAMDBG` | stream debug. |
| `GGML_ALLOCATOR_DEBUG` | build-flag companion for allocator tracing. |
| `GGML_CUDA_MWR_DEBUG`, `GGML_CUDA_HC_BLK16_DEBUG`, `GGML_CUDA_IDX_RELU_SUM_LOG`, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH_DEBUG`, `GGML_CUDA_CONV_DEBUG`, `GGML_CUDA_CONV_FUSION_MULTI`, `LLAMA_HC_CN_DEBUG`, `LLAMA_HC_GATEMIX_DEBUG`, `LLAMA_QSA_SCORE_STRIP_DEBUG`, `GGML_CUDA_QSA_DEBUG` | feature-specific debug output. |
| `FA`, `KV`, `RS`, `GDN_DBG_A`, `GDN_DBG_P`, `GDN_DBG_ONES`, `GDN_DBG_DUMP`, `GDN_DBG_SAVE` | **internal probes.** Single/double-letter or `_DBG_` names used by debug dump blocks. Never set these in production — two of them take a value that selects a dump *mode*. |

---

## 12. Non-ggml environment (HIP/ROCm runtime)

These are not llama.cpp variables but they control how the delivery runs.

| variable | notes |
|---|---|
| `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | which GPUs are visible, in order. Part of every validated command (`0,1` or `0,1,2`). |
| `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` | must include the matching ROCm runtime libs, e.g. `/opt/rocm-7.14.1-gfx120X/lib`, or the build will not start. |
| `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | lower-level alternative to `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`; prefer `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. |
| `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY` | forces managed allocations; not used in this repo's validated configurations. |

There is **no** environment variable for thread pinning; use `-t` / `--cpu-mask` as described in §5.

---

## 13. Retired / superseded

| variable | status |
|---|---|
| `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_RESERVE_MIB=8192` | the pre-r20 server workaround. **No longer needed** — the default `1024` plus the r20 compute-buffer slack and the fail-soft arena yield cover it. |
| `MOE_ARENA_HEADROOM_MIB` | tried and **removed**. A flat arena headroom changes nothing: the failure is a realloc needing a block bigger than the one just freed, so the slack has to be on the *allocation*, not the arena. |
| `MTP_DRAFT_N_UBATCH=4` | was a workaround for the same failure; a cap is now the default (`512`), so this is just an over-tight value. |
| `GGML_HIP_NO_VMM` (build option, not runtime) | HIP VMM is **off by default** (`ON` = do not use VMM).  Whether to enable it is an open investigation — see `archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/FOLLOWUP-compute-arena-chunking.md`. |

---

## 14. Build-time gates (not environment variables)

These are compile-time, because a device-side runtime gate does not work cleanly here.

| flag | default | what |
|---|---|---|
| `-DGGML_HIP_NO_DPP_XOR` | off (DPP on) | restores `__shfl_xor` for the wave32 warp reductions on RDNA3/RDNA4 (PR #110's DPP lane exchange, folded into block 15).  The DPP path is **bit-identical** and speeds up the HC_MIX / Flash-Next band (measured on gfx1201 / ROCm 7.14: BF16 HC_MIX 58.84 -> 45.26 us at 4 tokens, 100.00 -> 62.55 us at 8, i.e. +23 % / +37 %; bandwidth-bound matmuls unchanged).  **There is deliberately no runtime env var**: a device-side runtime gate was implemented and A/B-tested but reproducibly wedged the FA prefill at ~4096 tokens with MTP, so it was dropped. |

---

## Maintaining this file

The tables were derived from the code, so re-derive rather than trust them after a block change:

```bash
# every variable the delivery adds or repoints, with the idiom used
for f in ~/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/patches/*.patch; do
  grep -hoE 'getenv *\( *"[A-Za-z0-9_]+"|GGML_ENV_STR *\( *"[A-Za-z0-9_]+"|env_int *\( *"[A-Za-z0-9_]+"' "$f"
done | grep -oE '"[A-Za-z0-9_]+"' | tr -d '"' | sort -u
```

Then, for each name, grep the tree for its usage.  **Do not** classify by name alone: `*_DISABLE_*` is
not consistently value-gated, and `*_FUSE_*` semantics changed from opt-in to kill-switch.  A variable
that is genuinely new should follow the repo's conventions: default-on if it helps (with the variable as
a *kill-switch* that restores the old behaviour), default-off only for a known-risky correctness
workaround, and a first line in the relevant block's `patches/README.md` note.
